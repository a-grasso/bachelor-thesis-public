<h1 class="unnumbered" id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>End-of-support dependencies within software development facilitate
risk and expense for development teams and project management. Within
open source developed software, end-of-support and its informational use
is a less established concept. This work elaborates and proposes a
theoretical concept of seven <em>EOS Factors</em> as core
characteristics of end-of-support dependencies within the <em>EOS
Abstraction Framework</em> and implements a software solution –
<em>deprec</em> – based on it, capable of detecting end-of-support
dependencies independent of projects, ecosystems, and information
sources. Leveraging information found in adjacent literature to the
end-of-support topic, the theoretical concept represents a framework of
abstracted information fostering abstracted and constant methodology in
a comprehensible and approachable way. Before implementation, a
requirements analysis was performed and a technical concept designed
according to elaborated requirements. Evaluation of the implementation
demonstrated that classifying dependencies as end-of-support by
combination of <em>EOS Factors</em> is a promising approach bearing
acceptable accuracy, although the evaluation set is not representative
and the implementation focused on feasibility and practicability.
Concluding that <em>deprec</em> has its use in practice, the software
development landscape can benefit from using <em>deprec</em> to gain
insights into the end-of-support status of dependencies and leveraging
its informational use to reduce risk and expense in further
development.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Open-source software plays a major part in software development. An
open-source security and risk analysis report shared by Synopsys’
Cybersecurity Research Center<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for 2022, resulted in 97
percent of 2,049 analyzed codebases across 17 industries depending on
open source, with 78 percent of code being open source <span
class="citation" data-cites="synopsys_analyst_2022">(Synopsys
2022)</span>. The same report states: “open source is the foundation for
every application we rely on today”, with the tendencies of using open
source steadily rising <span class="citation"
data-cites="synopsys_analyst_2022">(Synopsys 2022)</span>. Clearly, as
why should one spend resources developing already existing software,
i.e., reinventing the wheel, if someone else went through it already.
However, using open-source software written by others within one’s
project, without thinking about consequences and implications regarding
security and stability, is not recommended either. Open source must be
carefully selected for one’s project and carefully maintained within the
same without jeopardizing future development <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al. 2020,
1)</span>. Other than commercial software where responsibility of
reliability is offloaded to the respective company, open-source software
requires different techniques to manage (<span class="citation"
data-cites="synopsys_analyst_2022">(Synopsys 2022, 20)</span>; <span
class="citation" data-cites="wang_survival_2012">(J. Wang 2012,
369)</span>) and must be maintained in projects by development teams
themselves: awareness of component’s security and stability status,
applying patches and bug fixes, updating to newer versions, or replacing
them altogether. To be noted though, as the Synopsys Analysis Report
<span class="citation" data-cites="synopsys_analyst_2022">(2022,
11)</span> put it: “open source itself does not create risk, but its
mismanagement does”.</p>
<h2 id="problem-and-motivation">Problem and Motivation</h2>
<p>Open-source software used in projects, hereinafter referred to
generally as <em>dependencies</em>, become a problem that has to be
taken care of if they are to lose support and no longer being
maintained, not receiving bug fixes, updates, and patches. The Synopsys
Analysis Report <span class="citation"
data-cites="synopsys_analyst_2022">(2022, 19)</span> states that 88
percent of examined codebases contained open-source software with no
feature upgrades, no code improvements, and no security issues fixed in
the past two years. They further conclude that said open-source software
more likely was no longer maintained and thus falling into the
aforementioned problematic category, hereinafter referred to as
<em>end-of-support</em> <em>dependencies</em>. Research done in the
literature on open-source software supports this view: open-source
software projects, though, can be long-lived, are eventually abandoned
(<span class="citation" data-cites="khondhu_is_2013">(Khondhu,
Capiluppi, and Stol 2013)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="capiluppi_characteristics_2003">(Capiluppi, Lago, and
Morisio 2003, 9, 10)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="coelho_why_2017">(Coelho and Valente 2017)</span>).
Elaborating further, projects where end-of-support dependencies are
detected, as the latter fall out of date without updates and
maintenance, the former face compatibility and stability issues with
either other of their dependencies, their codebase, or both.
Furthermore, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) emerging for
any of those dependencies will remain vulnerable to abuse without
security updates, further risking security-related issues. Which in turn
would jeopardize project stability or foster to compliance issues.</p>
<p>From the perspective of dependency management, end-of-support
dependencies pose the general risk of demanding immediate attention to
at the very least decide how to proceed further and, in the worst case,
to be replaced immediately. If happening at a particular bad timing,
throwing the planning of the project overboard. The longer
end-of-support dependencies stay unrecognized, the higher the risk and
expense of dealing with consequential problems; the sooner they are
recognized, the better are risk and expense integrable in planning,
resulting in better managing possibilities.</p>
<p>Up to now, dependencies without support are discovered to a large
extent only if they are checked manually or causing problems. Without
occasion, however, dependencies loosing support usually remain
undiscovered <span class="citation"
data-cites="bogart_when_2015">(Bogart, Kästner, and Herbsleb 2015,
3)</span>. Although there exist solutions to automate updating
dependencies or for security assessment of dependencies, there is no
prophylactic approach to specifically reduce risk and expense dealing
with dependencies loosing support (<span class="citation"
data-cites="xu_why_2020">(Xu et al. 2020, 780)</span>; <span
class="citation" data-cites="wang_empirical_2020">(Y. Wang et al. 2020,
1)</span>). Within software development, there were no existent entities
found, maintaining a database providing reference for development teams
and providing insights about dependencies and their end-of-support
status. Since the definition of end-of-support and when a dependency
should be considered as such varies depending on the project context,
and no common approach has been found on how dependencies should be
considered as end-of-support, there is a lack of reliable and
context-independent automated dependency analysis in the software
development landscape that focuses on the reliability of dependencies in
terms of end-of-support (<span class="citation"
data-cites="xu_why_2020">(Xu et al. 2020, 780)</span>; <span
class="citation" data-cites="wang_empirical_2020">(Y. Wang et al. 2020,
1, 4)</span>).</p>
<h2 id="methods-and-approach">Methods and Approach</h2>
<p>As the approach of automated end-of-support dependency detection is
to some degree novel in the software development landscape, it is
necessary to build a theoretical conception of classifying dependencies
as end-of-support to function as core functionality of the software
solution. Following a solid theoretical concept, to design and implement
a software solution within the scope of this work, a requirements
analysis is necessary.</p>
<p>With a theoretical basis of the core functionality and set
requirements, a software solution is conceptualized that can
automatically detect end-of-support dependencies, hereinafter referred
to as under the title <em>deprec</em>. Considering the concept and
respecting requirements, <em>deprec</em> is implemented, presented and
further discussed its technical possibilities and limitations as well as
evaluated regarding its usability.</p>
<h1 id="theoretic-basis">Conception of a Theoretical Basis</h1>
<p>This chapter addresses the field of open-source software, open-source
dependencies, dependency management and development insights, extracting
knowledge in regard to helping to define the domain of end-of-support
dependencies. Further, making use to set the playing field for further
proceedings by defining the classification by which dependencies are
classified and the approach to classifying them.</p>
<h2 id="validating-the-necessity-for-a-novel-approach">Validating the
Necessity for a Novel Approach</h2>
<p>To set the ground for a theoretical basis of classifying dependencies
as end-of-support, it was important to validate that the approach of
end-of-support dependency detection is novel and to justify why it was
necessary to elaborate a theoretical basis for it.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="part-zero-non-existent-solutions">Part Zero:
Non-existent Solutions</h3>
<p>Taking a step back, before looking at the status quo in terms of
end-of-support, existing solutions with the broad task of analyzing
dependencies can be evaluated whether they cover the informational use
of end-of-support dependencies.</p>
<p>Tools evaluated were software composition analysis platforms such as
<strong>(a)</strong> OWASP’s DependencyTrack<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><span id="dependencytrack"
label="dependencytrack"></span> or <strong>(b)</strong> Synopsys’ Black
Duck SCA<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

RenovateBot<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> capable of universal automated
dependency updates.</p>
<p>Considering DependencyTrack and Black Duck SCA, both tools rather
focus on identification and managing of security or quality risks such
as licensing and vulnerabilities, and components being out-of-date or
modified. Though dependencies may be identified as out-of-date, the
domain of end-of-support is far greater than the issue of whether a
dependency has a newer version. In a project that has existed for more
than 15 years, most dependencies can be considered as out-dated.
Nevertheless, this circumstance is no guarantee that dependencies or
technologies can no longer be used and are no longer supported. Though
updating dependencies in and of itself can be seen as prophylaxis to
avoid risks with out-dated dependencies, it is not sufficient for the
end-of-support domain. With which, on this note, rendering RenovateBot
neither fitting for the end-of-support domain and its informational
use.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a lack of tools that provide information about
the status of dependencies, and more specifically, whether they can
continue to be used going forward apart from vulnerabilities or
outdatedness.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="part-one-elusive-establishment">Part One:
Elusive Establishment</h3>
<p>End-of-support as a concept is no new creation. It is well-defined,
established, and applied in commercialized software like the adobe
suite<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> or big names in open-source
software<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> which have a certain position apart
from what is focused on in this work. They rather fall into the category
of software that is used as tooling or standalone rather than as
dependency.</p>
<p>Organizations, capable of controlling what happens with their
commercialized software and when it does in a centralized way, clearly
communicate if and when their software has reached its end-of-support.
They do so because the end-of-support status of standalone software has
its informational use established. Considering that updating standalone
software is less complicated and error-prone than updating dependencies
interconnected within a project, its users are enabled to continue using
their software and updating it, without the uncertainty of issues being
fixed, problems being dealt with and support being provided.</p>
<p>With open-source dependencies, though, the modus operandi is vastly
different. Due to development teams managing the handling of their
dependencies themselves, they do not tend to dedicate much time to
assessing dependencies if they are of no concern, let alone if they are
about to lose support. Development teams rather focus their limited time
on more prevalent issues such as performance and operations (<span
class="citation" data-cites="wang_empirical_2020">(Y. Wang et al.
2020)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="bogart_when_2015">(Bogart, Kästner, and Herbsleb
2015)</span>; <span class="citation"
data-cites="pashchenko_qualitative_2020">(Pashchenko, Vu, and Massacci
2020)</span>). Following that, dependency management for the most part
consists of problem-solving rather than problem prevention, though to
some degree updating dependency versions can be considered as such.
Nonetheless, due to the shifted focus on problem-solving, established
approaches in dependency management are issue-focused. This fact leads
on to why tools, though existing and enabling development teams to
advance their dependency management, none of them cover the
informational use of end-of-support status of dependencies.</p>
<p>Concluding that end-of-support and its informational use for
open-source dependencies is not well established, and its application
fragmented at best, it has been elusive to serve as is in defining a
theoretical basis for classifying dependencies as end-of-support.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="part-two-inconclusive-approaches">Part Two:
Inconclusive Approaches</h3>
<p>A direct consequence of the non-well-establishment of informational
use of end-of-support status of dependencies is the even
less-established practice of assessing dependencies as such and,
therefore, approaches to do so become inconclusive. Leading with the
fact that literature covering this topic is limited to non-existent
<span class="citation" data-cites="valiev_ecosystem-level_2018">(Valiev,
Vasilescu, and Herbsleb 2018, 645)</span>, developers are set off on
their own. Excluding dependencies where effort is explicitly made to
communicate them as end-of-support<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, developers interested
in the informational use of end-of-support status of their dependencies,
have no choice than to assess themselves whether they think a particular
dependency is supported or not. By which characteristics and methods
developers would do that in detail can only be assumed, but vary from
developer to developer <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al.
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>It can be concluded: subjectivity enters into the assessment. Where
this is the case, the latter varies depending on the developer’s
experience, and the outcome of the assessment takes on a fluid
character.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="part-three-non-triviality">Part Three:
Non-Triviality</h3>
<p>Looking into detail of dependencies where their developers clearly
communicated them as end-of-support, factors that would precede onto
that can be extracted. Such factor would be the release cycle that would
have been suspended. For example, log4j<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> has
been abandoned since 2012 (i.e., no releases since 2012) in favor of its
successor. Though had its official end-of-support announcement<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> not until 2015, leaving a gap of
three years without a release before the official announcement.</p>
<p>Following that example, one could extrapolate the fact that a
suspended release cycle results in the fact that the dependency has lost
support. This, however, turns out to be not the case for the subset of
feature-complete dependencies. A survey conducted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="coelho_why_2017">Coelho and Valente
(2017)</span> had their interviewees answering, as to why their project
had no activity in the last year, that their projects were considered by
them as done. <span class="citation"
data-cites="valiev_ecosystem-level_2018">Valiev, Vasilescu, and Herbsleb
(2018, 647)</span> describes them appropriately: “[feature-complete
libraries] continue to deliver their intended use without active
maintenance” – though to be noted, differentiating between ’active’ and
’passive’ maintenance varies between projects and cannot be generalized.
In addition, the sturdier a base the dependency is built upon, the less
maintenance does a dependency need <span class="citation"
data-cites="coelho_why_2017">(Coelho and Valente 2017, 9)</span>.</p>
<p>Dependencies requiring no maintenance and no features to be added
would warrant a suspended release cycle, but not necessarily to be
considered as end-of-support. The ’owasp-java-encoder’ project<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> gives an example of this
indication. Its last release was in 2020 (two years ago as of this work)
but is passively maintained by its developers. Concluded by following
key points: low-maintenance and niche project, maintenance commits since
last release, non-lingering issues and organization-backed.</p>
<p>A suspended release cycle leads onto possible misinterpretation of
feature-complete dependencies as end-of-support. Considering sufficient
project activity supports in differentiating, though varies between
projects. In addition, project activity in and of itself can be
concluded as sufficient, depending on more detailed factors: commit
activity indicating maintenance, though again, maintenance could consist
of updating dependency versions or minor adjustments to the project;
handling user-related issues contraindicating abandonment; and so
on.</p>
<p>The point is that dependencies cannot be assessed as end-of-support
as is, without doing so in a non-comprehensible and non-constant way.
There are many ambiguous characteristics that speak for and against,
influencing each other and functioning differently depending on the
project and its context. In addition, different developers can share
different views and can make different claims based on differing
perspectives <span class="citation"
data-cites="valiev_ecosystem-level_2018">(Valiev, Vasilescu, and
Herbsleb 2018, 645)</span>. All in all, the assessment of whether a
dependency is end-of-support is not a trivial matter.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h3>
<p>In summary, any software developed based on elusive-established
concepts and based on inconclusive approaches, that attempts to find a
way through dense and entangled information will not stand up to the
demands of practice. What is necessary, is a basis that allows for an
abstracted and constant methodology to classify dependencies as
end-of-support in an approachable and comprehensive way. The theoretical
concept proposed hereinafter introduces a holistic approach to
classifying dependencies as end-of-support with abstracted concepts
based on previously conducted research and evaluations in thematically
adjacent literature as well as established concepts therein.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-support-dependencies">End-of-support Dependencies</h2>
<p>Decentralized and collaborative development is common for open-source
software. Oftentimes under the wings of an organization, but not less
often developed by independent developers. End-of-support takes the
place in that this decentralized and collaborative association of
developers no longer invests resources in the development and
maintenance of such a dependency. Especially issues, CVEs and bugs are
not handled nor fixed.</p>
<p>End-of-support though is not a symptom of decommissioning open-source
software, rather the result of it. In the process of decommissioning
open-source software, similar predicates can be used to describe
different characteristics of an open-source software project soon to be
decommissioned. <a href="#fig:eox-funnel" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:eox-funnel">[fig:eox-funnel]</a> depicts the
differentiation of end-of-support from other similar predicates:</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="end-of-development-service-maintenance">End-Of-Development/-Service/-Maintenance</h4>
<p>These terms define that either, in sequence from left to right, use
case driven, user-driven or project-driven effort is no longer present
in an open-source software project.</p>
<p>Under use case-driven effort falls regular development to advance a
dependency in its use case: e.g., adding features, enhancing
performance, providing utility. User-driven effort is everything
triggered by the dependencies users: e.g., implementing requested
features or providing support for users’ issues. Tasks that are
necessary for a dependencies’ continuation are associated with
project-driven effort: e.g., fixing issues or CVEs, or regular
maintenance like updating dependency versions and keeping the project
itself tidy and up-to-date.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="end-of-support">End-Of-Support</h4>
<p>End-of-service, end-of-development and end-of-maintenance precede the
predicate of end-of-support, whereas the former to a degree is a
sufficient, and the latter two are a necessary condition. They are not
to be seen as strict requirements though, that if one or a combination
is satisfied, a dependency wanders on to the domain of end-of-support.
The aforementioned subset of feature-complete dependencies, under
particularly opaque circumstances, can satisfy all of them, without
necessarily satisfying end-of-support. The node module ’st’<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> gives an example of this. Its
repository is inactive as of May 2021 and satisfies all three
predicates, but the according package on its registry<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
has 350 thousand weekly downloads. One could argue that with such
numerous users and such a small project, problems of any kind are rather
unusual, but they would be fixed.</p>
<p>End-of-support is paraphrased as the following: if problems arise,
one is on their own. The leading question is, when assessing
dependencies about their end-of-support status, whether one can expect
of problems to be taken care of. Problems of any kind, be it bugs,
issues of any kind, feature requests, and especially CVEs. A dependency
being end-of-support implies two scenarios for development teams using
said dependency: On the one hand, taking over maintenance and taking
care of the dependency themselves, be it only for themselves or publicly
<span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al. 2020, 6,
7)</span>. On the other hand, being forced to replace the dependency
altogether.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-life">End-Of-Life</h4>
<p>End-of-life is a rather special case, what differentiates it from
end-of-support is the broad consensus about a dependencies state and its
diminishing use. Its use case to labeling dependencies as such, if not
officially disclosed, is rather concentrated on old dependencies, as
those are less complicated to be labeled as end-of-life.</p>
<p>Though, for this work and its intentions, end-of-life does not bring
more informational use worth pursuing than end-of-support does. From the
view of dependency management, for example, the important question is
whether one can continue using a specific dependency rather than being
forced to update or replace altogether. To answer this question,
assessing a given dependency about its end-of-support status is
sufficient, voiding the need of further assessing if the given
dependency also is considered as end-of-life.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-dependencies-as-end-of-support">Classifying
Dependencies as End-of-support</h2>
<p>With end-of-support set within the context of open-source
dependencies, the next step is to elaborate the approach of classifying
dependencies as end-of-support. By mimicking how developers approach
dependencies about suitability, reliability and sustainability, and
incorporating insights about dependencies projects, a new approach is
distilled with which dependencies can be classified as
end-of-support.</p>
<h3 id="sec:def-information">Defining Information</h3>
<p>Primary literature on end-of-support of open-source dependencies was
difficult to find, and certainly did not address approaches to
classifying dependencies as end-of-support. To bypass close to
non-existent literature that could have been fully relied on, it was
necessary to approach the matter differently.</p>
<p>By reviewing literature that is thematically close, useful
information was collected for the theoretical concept that would serve
as the information base for classifying dependencies as end-of-support.
The literature reviewed, fundamentally covered the following topics:
open-source software, open-source dependencies, dependency management
and development insights. With guiding questions written down in <a
href="#fig:guiding_questions" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:guiding_questions">[fig:guiding_questions]</a>,
existing interviews and surveys, qualitative and quantitative research,
and empirical evaluations were consulted. To be noted, ’library’ used in
referenced literature is to be equated with ’dependency’.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="sec:d1">Answering D1: How do developers
choose a library?</h4>
<p>Leading question <em>D1</em> was split into two parts that were of
interest for further use: Where do developers search for information and
what kind of information are they looking for? <em>D1</em> was important
as assessing dependencies as end-of-support requires information
gathered from somewhere and the same used somehow, having initial
indications and directions was beneficial towards that task.<br />
Place number one to search for information about a dependency is where
it is developed. Source code repositories are the place where developers
search first to gather information and consider whether a given
dependency fits or not. <span class="citation"
data-cites="pashchenko_qualitative_2020">Pashchenko, Vu, and Massacci
(2020)</span> had their interviewees answering source code repositories
as their primary information source, as the latter is not only focused
on a dependencies source code in and of itself, but also provides useful
information and metadata beyond that.</p>
<p>Although a dependencies’ repository is the place number one to browse
through first, <span class="citation"
data-cites="pashchenko_qualitative_2020">Pashchenko, Vu, and Massacci
(2020)</span> observed in their study that developers were less
interested in low-level details of the project’s source code and rather
referred to high-level information. They further state that their
interviewed developers indicated to mostly rely on community support of
a library. Therefore, high-level information investigated consisted of
popularity measures such as the user base of the library, activity
measures such as commit frequency or the number of open and resolved
issues and how quickly they were fixed, and the project’s
contributors.</p>
<h5 id="section"><span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">Larios-Vargas et al.
(2020)</span></h5>
<p>conducted a more in-depth survey about practitioners (i.e.,
developers) and how they select their libraries. Evaluating their
results, they grouped aspects received by practitioners into three
categories of factors: technical, human and economical.</p>
<h6 id="technical-factors">Technical Factors</h6>
<p>considered by practitioners in their survey were functionality,
quality of the development, type of project and release process. Since
the former three are less tangible for the use case of this work, only
the latter was considered in more detail.</p>
<p>Practitioners in their survey stated that characteristics associated
with a libraries release provide them indicators to predict for how long
a library will be alive. Active maintenance, long-term support, maturity
and steady evolution were characteristics evaluated in their survey.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">Larios-Vargas et al.
(2020)</span> summarizes that practitioners would assess said
characteristics by a variety of measures and in non-standard ways.
Active maintenance, for example, by volume of contributions, exploring
how regularly libraries were updated, observing if the most recent
release happened recently and assessing if contributors were actively
working on new features or fixing bugs. Further, long-term support would
be substituted by the libraries stability and maturity, examining the
volume of bugs identified per release, one practitioner introduced the
wording of ’getting enough momentum’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al. 2020,
5)</span>.</p>
<h6 id="human-factors">Human Factors</h6>
<p>such as the libraries’ community and organizations partaking were
considered by practitioners. End-of-support related, both the just
listed were of interested as they act as central drivers behind a
library: according to practitioners, communities play a positive and
influential role. They include the group of users who adopted the
library in their projects and the group of developers maintaining and
providing technical support for the library. Practitioners considered
the popularity of a library or its contributors partaking in the
project, to assess its community and whether it was active or not.
Popularity would be measured by practitioners, for example, by number of
downloads. Contributors were paid attention to, whether they were
actively engaged in the project, their responsiveness to issues or what
their experience was with the library. Organizations behind a library
would let practitioners perceive trustworthiness of the library,
associating it with lower risk.</p>
<h6 id="economic-factors">Economic Factors</h6>
<p>are considered crucial by practitioners to also be evaluated. Total
cost of ownership was proposed in their study and consisted of the
libraries license and the maintenance costs and risks associated with
using a library. Practitioners cited licensing to be a crucial factor:
“if I need to apply a security fix, it would be nice if we can change it
ourselves” <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al. 2020,
8)</span>. Licensing prohibiting change by its users coupled with
lacking sufficient release cycles would be reason for practitioners to
avoid a library.<br />
Regarding <em>Human Factors</em>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="pano_factors_2018">Pano, Graziotin, and Abrahamsson
(2018)</span> had their interviewees supporting the importance of the
community of a library, and also concludes “the community [being] the
heart of an open source project” <span class="citation"
data-cites="pano_factors_2018">(Pano, Graziotin, and Abrahamsson 2018,
20)</span>. The better responsiveness of the community, the larger its
size, the bigger and more prevalent its user base and how active the
community is would favor their analyzed frameworks in being
adopted.<br />
Summarizing <span class="citation"
data-cites="pashchenko_qualitative_2020">Pashchenko, Vu, and Massacci
(2020)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">Larios-Vargas et al.
(2020)</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="pano_factors_2018">Pano, Graziotin, and Abrahamsson
(2018)</span>, developers used information when selecting a library
about <strong>(a)</strong> the libraries’ project activity and
<strong>(b)</strong> the libraries’ community. Whereas, information
considered under <strong>(a)</strong> highlights whether a given
dependency is reliable <em>now</em>, information considered under
<strong>(b)</strong> highlights whether a given dependency will remain
reliable <em>going forward</em>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="sec:r1">Answering R1: What determines the
survival and sustainability of libraries?</h4>
<p>Other than <em>D1</em>, leading question <em>R1</em> focuses entirely
on the domain of libraries themselves. The idea of <em>R1</em> was to
analyze characteristics of surviving and sustainable libraries and their
associated repositories, to derive what contraindicates the assessment
of dependencies as end-of-support.</p>
<p>Ahead, what drives the survivability and sustainability of a library
and its repository is simple: contributor effort. As open-source
projects live by their users’ contributions, be it participation or
development, a lack of effort will drive a library eventually into
abandonment. Though this being the case, what brings in more complexity
is the question of how different factors and characteristics of a
library itself or its repository influence contributor effort.</p>
<p>What is considered by contributor effort is, for example, from the
view of developers, development activity such as commits or releases,
support activity such as handling issues or fixing bugs and maintenance
activity such as updating dependencies. From the view of the libraries
users, for example, partaking in discussions, generating traffic about
the library or reporting issues.<br />
According to <span class="citation" data-cites="coelho_why_2017">Coelho
and Valente (2017)</span> that analyzed systems no longer under
maintenance by interviewing their developers, among characteristics of
failing libraries, one of the prevalent reasons for abandonment was lack
of time or lack of interest. As open-source projects live by their
users’ contribution effort, both would result in declining project
activity. Following that, commit and release activity would decrease,
issue handling and support provided would plunge, and maintenance
activity would stop. In addition, interviewees further stated being
usurped by competition or becoming obsolete as to why their projects
were abandoned. Both would result in a similar situation of declining
project activity, though, warranted as further effort would be
voided.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="coelho_why_2017">Coelho and
Valente (2017)</span> further states that projects with low
maintainability and based on outdated technology face abandonment by
their interviewees. By arguing that high-maintenance libraries claim
more resources than low-maintenance libraries and low maintainability
and outdated technology would warrant the former, libraries face a
higher risk of being abandoned. They cannot generate enough contributing
effort to deal with their higher maintenance needs.</p>
<p>Elaborating further, <span class="citation"
data-cites="valiev_ecosystem-level_2018">Valiev, Vasilescu, and Herbsleb
(2018)</span> sheds light from a different angle, researching
ecosystem-level determinants of sustained activity. They analyzed
projects and their position in their ecosystem and relationships with
projects upstream and downstream, concluding that the size of downstream
dependencies, i.e., project dependents, are related to greater
probability of the projects’ survival. They reason that the larger a
project’s dependents, the bigger is the pool of potential contributors
the project can attract contributors from. Similar was partially
confirmed by them concerning organizations standing behind projects, as
organizations also present a pool of potential resources. Though, for
example, considering <span class="citation"
data-cites="comino_planning_2007">Comino, Manenti, and Parisi
(2007)</span>, licensing could have a toll on how successfully a library
can attract new contributors. As contributors usually emerge from a
user-standpoint, strong copy-right licensing can prevent potential users
to adopt a library <span class="citation"
data-cites="larios-vargas_selecting_2020">(Larios-Vargas et al. 2020,
8)</span>, that would then count as loosing potential contributors.
Considering <span class="citation" data-cites="coelho_why_2017">Coelho
and Valente (2017)</span>, project practices may also affect whether
users become contributors. They state open-source development or
repository practices like providing continuous integration, the project
having a README or LICENSE file, and availability of a project homepage
or guidelines for contributing, to be relevant.<br />
From the point of view of how libraries assert their presence in the
open-source software landscape, the concept of established libraries can
be derived from <span class="citation"
data-cites="samoladas_survival_2010">Samoladas, Angelis, and Stamelos
(2010)</span>. The better they are already established in the
open-source software landscape, the harder it is to abandon them. <span
class="citation" data-cites="samoladas_survival_2010">Samoladas,
Angelis, and Stamelos (2010)</span> backs establishment up with
prolonged activity and presence, proven value of the library, and a
sustainable community.<br />
Moving onto the topic of a libraries’ community. Reciting <span
class="citation" data-cites="pano_factors_2018">Pano, Graziotin, and
Abrahamsson (2018)</span> that “the community is the heart of an open
source project”, its influence on a project’s success is non-negligable.
<span class="citation" data-cites="comino_planning_2007">Comino,
Manenti, and Parisi (2007)</span> supports this, as they conclude the
size of a libraries’ community having non-linear impact on the
probability of success.</p>
<p>Elaborating further, preceding that a libraries’ community can be
characterized by the popularity of the library, and <span
class="citation" data-cites="dey_are_2018">Dey and Mockus (2018)</span>
providing insights into metrics used to predict changes in library
popularity, these metrics can be used to gain insights into what a
libraries’ community is influenced by. <span class="citation"
data-cites="dey_are_2018">Dey and Mockus (2018)</span> found the
activity of a library, e.g., number of releases and commits, and the
overall commitment by its users, to be the top predictors of change in
popularity. Among other predictors, worth mentioning, is the popularity
of upstream and downstream dependencies of a focal package. To be noted,
the number of downloads of a focal package was used to substitute for
its popularity.</p>
<p>Evaluating these findings, one could argue that the popular and
prestigious a library is in its ecosystem, the more supporting and
active is its community and the longer will it prevail. For example,
top-performers such as React<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> or Vue<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
are fundamental frameworks in web development, accordingly are their
communities established, and both frameworks will be used ever after. In
support, <span class="citation" data-cites="borges_whats_2018">Borges
and Valente (2018)</span> also highlights the measure of popularity and
summarizes that a projects’ popularity was influenced by whether it was
backed up by organizations or owned by established developers. Though,
the most discriminative features were project-related, such as the
recency of the last update and overall project activity.<br />
Summarizing leading question <em>R1</em>, a libraries survival and
sustainability is kick-started by its repositories qualities and active
development attracting users and with it potential contributors. The
bigger the user base, the bigger its community. With a steady
contributing effort of evolving the library, the same gains popularity
and establishes itself in its ecosystem. From there on, retaining
contribution effort is key to survival and secured by active maintenance
and support. All in all, a libraries’ repository starts it, but the
libraries’ community keeps it going.</p>

dependencies as end-of-support. In it are domains of information
sectioned where information can be categorized to.</p>
<h5 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h5>
<p>includes information about the dependencies’ ecosystem, such as a
ranking<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> among similar dependencies or the
number of downloads. The domain further subjects <em>Upstream</em> and
<em>Downstream</em> subdomains, in which information about focal
dependencies up- and downstream is categorized. For example, the
popularity of dependencies and dependents of a focal dependency.</p>
<h5 id="community">Community</h5>
<p>contains information about a dependencies’ community, e.g., its
popularity or its size. Further, information about distinct contributors
or users is categorized into their responding subdomains
<em>Contributors</em> and <em>Users</em>. The former includes
information such as public repositories and their popularity, or what
organizations they belong to. In the latter is information categorized
such as a users’ participation activity.</p>
<h5 id="repository">Repository</h5>
<p>accounts for the largest informational content and includes
information like the repositories’ owner, if the repository is backed up
by organizations or which license the repository subdues. Further,
dividing information into subdomains <em>Issues</em>, <em>Commits</em>
and <em>Releases</em> with according information related to the
subdomain.</p>
<h5 id="dependency">Dependency</h5>
<p>lastly includes all other information that cannot be explicitly
categorized into the other domains, for example, information about CVEs
of a dependency or if newer versions of the same dependency are
available.</p>

<h4 id="characterizing-informational-value">Characterizing Informational
Value</h4>
<p>After categorizing information into their domain, the same
information can be characterized in terms of its informational value
into two distinct properties: <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em>. To
be noted though that neither of the two is specific to a particular
information domain.</p>
<h5 id="signals">Signals</h5>
<p>are one-dimensional interpreted pieces of information. Given the
following example: above is stated that organizations behind a library
would let practitioners perceive trustworthiness of the library,
associating it with lower risk. To utilize this insight, the following
signal can be derived: is a library backed up by an organization?
One-dimensional as a signal provokes the information to be either ’yes’
or ’no’, or other forms of the like. Whereby ’yes’ and ’no’ can be
interpreted independently and without further context, with which
<em>Signals</em> are considered as substantial information.</p>
<p>More <em>Signals</em>, for example, could be: <strong>(a)</strong>
was the last release within the last month?; <strong>(b)</strong> does
the repository have contribution guidelines?; <strong>(c)</strong> does
the repository have known (open) vulnerabilities?; or
<strong>(d)</strong> is the library copy-right licensed?</p>
<h5 id="metrics">Metrics</h5>
<p>are multidimensional interpreted information. Unlike
<em>Signals</em>, which are distinct, <em>Metrics</em> are continuous.
Given the commit frequency referenced before, which can take on a
variety of values, <em>Metrics</em> are not readily interpretable and
require further contextualization. For example, a commit frequency of
ten commits a month has a different informational value depending on the
projects’ momentum. For rather small projects that frequency is
sufficient as more is not needed to maintain it. Whereas, five commits
can be a day’s contingent for other (bigger) projects. In addition,
<em>Metrics</em> are not bound to be a statistical measure, but can also
be a qualitative measure, such as the quality of technical support given
by developers of a dependency.</p>
<p>More information to be considered as <em>Metrics</em> could be:
<strong>(a)</strong> release frequency; <strong>(b)</strong> average
time to close opened issues; <strong>(c)</strong> the average time for
developers to first respond to issues; or <strong>(d)</strong> the
popularity of a library.</p>
<h3 id="sec:statements">Abstracting Information into
<em>Statements</em></h3>
<p>In the attempt to develop a comprehensible and approachable
theoretical concept, the use of information collected in <a
href="#sec:def-information" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="sec:def-information">[sec:def-information]</a> in its
present form turned out to be too complex and fine-grained to deal with.
It was not reasonably possible to combine said information and weight it
against each other to classify dependencies as end-of-support.</p>
<p>Since developing a theoretical construct with information that is too
fine-grained would not be flexible enough for practice, an approach to
map the information landscape built in <a href="#sec:def-information"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="sec:def-information">[sec:def-information]</a> into more
manageable plots was considered. Therefore, this section proposes the
approach of abstracting the information in <a
href="#sec:def-information" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="sec:def-information">[sec:def-information]</a> into
<em>Statements</em>.</p>
<h5 id="statements">Statements</h5>
<p>as used in this work, are an initial abstraction mapping that shapes
information to facilitate handling, combination and trade-off in
classifying dependencies as end-of-support.</p>
<p>The following are <em>Statements</em> and their detailed composition
to be used in classifying dependencies as end-of-support, derived from
<a href="#sec:def-information" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="sec:def-information">[sec:def-information]</a> and
utilizing information and insights therein:</p>
<h6 id="project-quality">Project Quality</h6>
<p>gives measures whether a dependencies project follows common
open-source practices such as providing a README or LICENSE file,
contribution guidelines, and templates. Though, also covering topics
like development practices such as adopting continuous integration.</p>
<h6 id="activity">Activity</h6>
<p>of the dependencies’ repository is one of the most prevalent factors
contraindicating end-of-support. Arguing that a dependency cannot be
considered as end-of-support if its repository is sufficiently
active.</p>
<p>The leading question of <em>Activity</em> is whether activity in the
dependencies repository contraindicates end-of-support.
<em>Activity</em> concerns topics like development and maintenance
statistically. To assess stated topics, information mapped is foremost
from the <em>Repository</em> domain and its <em>Commits</em>,
<em>Issues</em>, and <em>Releases</em> subdomains. More detailed,
<em>Activity</em> can utilize, for example, commit and release frequency
and how many issues the repository receives. As <em>Activity</em>
concerns information statistically, further contextualization, for
example, how recent activity happened, is not considered.</p>
<h6 id="impact">Impact</h6>
<p>similar to the <em>Activity</em> statement, covers the
<em>Issues</em> and <em>Releases</em> subdomains, but assessing whether
recent activity was impactful. <em>Impact</em> serves the purpose of
measuring the impact of change by evaluating whether recent activity
brought change to the repository, assisting in differentiating, for
example, between projects in development and maintenance.</p>
<p>Differentiating, for example, between feature commits or automated
dependency updates. Projects such as the former, with predominantly
impactful frequent activity, are to be considered differently than
projects such as the latter, with predominantly lesser impact frequent
activity.</p>
<h6 id="recentness">Recentness</h6>
<p>focuses on the question if the repository has gotten updated
recently. It utilizes information mainly from the <em>Repository</em>
domain, specifically the <em>Commits</em> and <em>Releases</em>
subdomains. A recently updated, especially recently released dependency
is contraindicating end-of-support.</p>
<h6 id="processing">Processing</h6>
<p>is the next <em>Statement</em> proposed. The gist of it is to state
whether a dependencies repository provides support to its users,
contraindicating end-of-support.</p>
<p>The leading question for <em>Processing</em> is whether a repository
processes its issues and evaluating how issues are handled. By tapping
into information from the <em>Repository</em> domain, specifically the
<em>Issues</em> subdomain, this <em>Statement</em> concerns the support
topic and whether provided support can be considered as qualifying. In
detail, <em>Processing</em> can utilize information such as the closing
time of issues and how efficient the repository keeps their issues in
check.</p>
<h6 id="engagement">Engagement</h6>
<p>like <em>Processing</em> uses information from the <em>Issue</em>
subdomain, but differs in the sense that, apart from <em>Processing</em>
concerning whether issues are processed, it assesses whether
specifically not closed issues are engaged with by the repositories
contributors or not given any attention at all. Issues not being closed
but actively discussed contraindicate end-of-support, with which
<em>Engagement</em> somewhat functions as a counterweight to
<em>Processing</em>.</p>
<h6 id="core-team">Core Team</h6>
<p>addresses whether a dependency and its repository has dedicated
contributors. Using the <em>Repository</em> domain and information about
the activity of contributors via the <em>Commits</em> subdomain,
<em>Core Team</em> assesses whether the repository has a strong enough
team to keep the dependency afloat.</p>
<h6 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h6>
<p>indicates whether dependencies have associated vulnerabilities,
especially CVEs, and if those vulnerabilities have been fixed or not. On
one hand, existing but fixed vulnerabilities would indicate maintenance
and support, on the other hand, not fixed vulnerabilities and for how
long they are known, especially CVEs, would indicate towards
end-of-support.</p>
<h6 id="backporting-lts">Backporting / LTS</h6>
<p>deals with the question if the practice of back porting is observable
in a repositories’ development. Meaning that developers also patch major
issues and especially CVEs into past versions of the dependency. The
term ’long-term-support’ is used for such versions treated with higher
priority. The purpose of this <em>Statement</em> is to differentiate
when classifying a dependency as end-of-support and the former is not
considered as the latter, whether the same applies for a specific
version of said dependency.</p>
<h6 id="rivalry">Rivalry</h6>
<p>describes a dependency of contextual competition it faces. For
example, whether newer versions of the same dependency are available or
alternative dependencies covering the same use case and how popular
those are. The purpose of this <em>Statement</em> is to assess how broad
the possibilities are for users to replace the dependency.</p>
<h6 id="popularity">Popularity</h6>
<p>measures just that: how popular is a dependency. Possibilities to
utilize different substitutes for popularity, as also used in
literature, are, for example, downloads or how many projects the
dependency is used by. The <em>Popularity</em> <em>Statement</em>,
though, has no specific domain it utilizes information from.</p>
<h6 id="network">Network</h6>
<p>as <em>Statement</em> has its purpose to measure how networked a
dependency is. Meaning how many connections a dependency has, be it to
other dependencies, dependent projects, contributors, organizations and
so on. The background for this <em>Statement</em> is that one connection
could be a possible resource the dependency can use, arguing that bigger
and more prevalent dependencies have more connections going outwards
than smaller ones, and, therefore, a higher possibility to sustain.</p>
<h6 id="upstream">Upstream</h6>
<p>evaluates the upstream context of a dependency about disadvantageous
characteristics. The gist of <em>Upstream</em> is that, as an extreme
example, if a dependency itself uses end-of-support dependencies, the
higher the probability that the dependency itself is end-of-support.</p>
<h6 id="downstream">Downstream</h6>
<p>similar to <em>Upstream</em>, evaluates the downstream context of a
dependency. Arguing that if a dependency is used by many dependents and
those are being active themselves, the higher is the dependencies chance
of not becoming end-of-support. The bigger the number of dependents, the
bigger the possible resource pool as numerous depend on it.</p>
<h6 id="backup">Backup</h6>
<p>discloses information about how strong a dependency is backed up by
utilizing the <em>Repository</em> and <em>Community</em> domain, and
information like organizations or sponsors therein. The more backed up a
dependency, the higher the chance of survival.</p>
<h6 id="prestige">Prestige</h6>
<p>provides insights about the contributors of a dependency. Differences
can be found on projects with core contributors who have a certain
prestige, i.e., backed by organizations, sponsored, high overall
activity, and projects with contributors voluntarily contributing in
their spare time. <em>Prestige</em> gives a measure to that. Arguing
that dependencies being developed by prestigious contributors have a
higher chance of surviving than those without, <em>Prestige</em> can
indicate towards higher probability of support to be expected.</p>
<h6 id="participation">Participation</h6>
<p>looks into how active the dependencies users participate in its
project that is specifically not development or maintenance related.
<em>Participation</em> considers, for example, user activity in issue
discussions. Its purpose is to further assess the dependencies community
and how active and engaged its users are.</p>
<h6 id="marking">Marking</h6>
<p>considers preliminary factors that explicitly consequent the
dependency to be classified as end-of-support. For example, if the
dependencies developers officially disclosed their dependency as
end-of-support via official channels, the project’s homepage, or
somewhere stated in the repository.</p>
<h6 id="licensing">Licensing</h6>
<p>covers the beneficiality of a dependencies licensing if a situation
occurs that given users have to fix their dependency themselves. Though
that this <em>Statement</em> cannot independently indicate towards
end-of-support, it influences the classification of a dependency as
end-of-support. It follows the argument that restrictive licensing
hinders the adoption of a dependency and the potential of another party
taking over maintenance. The latter may be the case if the dependency is
no longer maintained and support from its original developers is
lost.</p>
<h3 id="eos-afs">The <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> and <em>EOS
Factors</em></h3>
<p><em>Statements</em>, introduced in <a href="#sec:statements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:statements">2.3.2</a>,
enable the theoretical concept of classifying dependencies as
end-of-support to be based on more abstract and constant information.
Further, subdividing <em>Statements</em> into distinct factors
representing core characteristics of a dependency in terms of
end-of-support, proposed in this work as <em>EOS Factors</em>, leverages
the theoretical concept into a more comprehensive and approachable one.
Finally, the framework for classifying dependencies as end-of-support
referenced in this work as <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> is
proposed as the core of <a href="#theoretic-basis"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="theoretic-basis">2</a>. The
<em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> utilizes aforementioned <em>EOS
Factors</em> and enables combination, trade-off, and conclusion of
information to classify dependencies as end-of-support.</p>
<h5 id="eos-factors">EOS Factors</h5>
<p>utilize the informational value of <em>Statements</em>, combining
them and setting them into relation. Following are the seven distinct
<em>EOS Factors</em> used further in this work to classify dependencies
as end-of-support:</p>
<h6 id="effort">Effort</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about how much momentum a dependency has.
Key <em>Statements</em> are: <em>Activity</em>, <em>Core Team</em>,
<em>Recentness</em> and <em>Impact</em>.</p>
<h6 id="support">Support</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about how much support a dependency
provides to its users. Key <em>Statements</em> are: <em>Processing</em>,
<em>Engagement</em> and <em>Backporting / LTS</em>.</p>
<h6 id="ecosystem-1">Ecosystem</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about its ecosystem and whether beneficial
and advantageous factors are given. Key <em>Statements</em> are:
<em>Upstream</em> and <em>Downstream</em>.</p>
<h6 id="community-1">Community</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about its community and whether the
dependency could rely on it to receive sufficient ’drive’ to survive.
Key <em>Statements</em> are: <em>Backup</em>, <em>Prestige</em> and
<em>Participation</em>.</p>
<h6 id="interconnectedness">Interconnectedness</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about its integration and establishment in
the software development landscape. Key <em>Statements</em> are:
<em>Popularity</em> and <em>Network</em>.</p>
<h6 id="circumstances">Circumstances</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about different factors influencing the
classification of a dependency as end-of-support. It functions as a
general collection basin for <em>Statements</em> that are not used
elsewhere. Key <em>Statements</em> are: <em>Licensing</em>,
<em>Rivalry</em> and <em>Project Quality</em>.</p>
<h6 id="deity-given">Deity-Given</h6>
<p>characterizes a dependency about preliminary factors indicating
end-of-support, which would void further assessment. Key
<em>Statements</em> are: <em>Marking</em> and
<em>Vulnerabilities</em></p>
<h5 id="the-eos-abstraction-framework">The EOS Abstraction
Framework</h5>
<p>functions as a framework within where <em>EOS Factors</em> can be
used to classify dependencies as end-of-support. <a
href="#fig:eos_abstr_framework" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:eos_abstr_framework">[fig:eos_abstr_framework]</a>
summarizes <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> and sets them in
relation to each other, depicting the domain of the framework. Further
implementation based on it is open to modification of how individual
<em>EOS Factors</em> are handled. Meaning by that, the <em>EOS
Abstraction Framework</em> does not prescribe that, for example,
<em>Community</em> and <em>Ecosystem</em> in their informational value
have to be evaluated together with a 2:1 ratio. The <em>EOS Abstraction
Framework</em> much more acts as an <em>enabler</em>, enabling
individual utilization and policies to assess dependencies as
end-of-support in a more approachable and comprehensive way, rather than
enforcing predefined rules or interrelationships not being able to
adjust to different situations.</p>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements Analysis</h1>
<p>In advance of designing and implementing a software solution,
presenting general conditions and use cases, and analyzing requirements
for the same is a vital step to establish a foundation to be built upon.
The goal of this chapter is to define requirements for a software
solution detecting end-of-support dependencies. To be noted is that the
analysis is done within the context that the software solution
implemented in this work cannot finally cover everything there is to
cover within such a large and differentiated field of dependencies.
Requirements discussed are designed under the premise so that the
software solution can remain persistent and be extended even after this
work.</p>
<p>Ahead, conditions and use cases are catered towards the use of the
software solution within the software development department of Device
Insight, which this work is supported by. The same applies for set
requirements, which were internally discussed within the same
department.</p>
<h2 id="gc-and-uc">General Conditions and Use Cases</h2>
<p>The foremost use case is to be able to analyze dependencies on a
project-based scope. Since projects can contain many dependencies, it
becomes tedious from a dependency management standpoint to analyze each
dependency individually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dependencies to be analyzed, concern projects from the
application and web development domain. This is set, as dependencies
used within the software development department of Device Insight mostly
come from these domains. Though possible to analyze dependencies from,
for example, docker containers<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> upon the base of
trivy<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, this not primarily focused on.</p>
<p>Integrating the software solution into Device Insights software
development department is planned within continuous integration
pipelines. Whereby results are valued over performance, as the need to
run end-of-support dependency analysis for projects is rather
infrequent.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="proj-ind">Project Independence</h3>
<p>Crucial for the usability of the software solution is the possibility
to use it independently of any project and context. Therefore, the
software solution should enable agnosticism of ecosystem, programming
language and build tool. In other words, the tool should be able to work
with any kind of dependency in any project.</p>
<p>As the landscape of software development is very broad, so are
distinctly different dependencies in use. The overarching purpose of
this requirement is to ensure agnosticism without demanding all kinds of
dependencies being covered from the get go.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="data-ind">Data Independence</h3>
<p>Consequential to is the need for the software solution to be able to
work with information from differing origins. This requirement ensures
that the software solution functions data origin agnostic. Since
different projects utilize different dependencies, which in turn have
different data origins, fetching information from one central data
origin covering all kinds of dependencies is not possible. For example,
developing an application in the NPM<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> ecosystem opens the
door to pulling information from <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/"><em>npmjs.com</em></a>. For applications
developed with Maven<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, for example, this is not possible.
Instead, information regarding the Maven ecosystem can be fetched, for
example from <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com/"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, following from the agnosticism of data origins, the
software solution has to be able to handle either missing or low-quality
data. Depending on the dependency, there is sometimes less and sometimes
more information to be obtained. Furthermore, the same applies to the
quality of the information. Following that, this requirement further
ensures that the software solution has to work with whatever data is
available for a given dependency. Though, it should be clear that by
above stated, any strict requirement of accuracy or validation is
voided. As the software solution has to be able to work with altering
and optional data origins, information fetched from said sources to be
evaluated on either informational correctness or reliability is not
demanded.</p>
<p>Similar to , the overarching purpose of this requirement is to ensure
data agnosticism without demanding to cover all kinds of dependency data
origins from the get go.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="expandability">Expandability</h3>
<p>To round out the previous two requirements, the software solution
must be designed to ensure expansion of dependency domains and thus data
origins. This requirement ensures that the software solution is
implemented so that, for the beginning, a limited set of dependencies is
supported, but being expandable to support not yet supported
dependencies. For example, initially supporting dependencies from the
Maven ecosystem, but being expandable to also support dependencies from
the NPM ecosystem.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="integrability">Integrability</h3>
<p>The requirement of has the purpose to ensure that the software
solution can be used under different premises. For example, to be used
as a command line interface tool, or be provided as a service. Depending
on the use case, having the possibility to choose how one integrates the
software solution into their workflows is nothing short of beneficial.
However, this requirement does not state to integrate the software
solution into different premises initially, though to ensure
integrability and to evaluate a suitable integration.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="out-of-scope">Out Of Scope</h3>
<p>The software solution presents an implementation of a theoretical
concept elaborated for the first time in this work. Given this
circumstance, the software solution and its assessment of dependencies
as end-of-support is more focused on feasibility and practicability.</p>
<p>How successful and accurate dependencies were assessed takes on a
secondary role. Therefore, the requirement of the software solution to
guarantee correctness of the assessment to its users is not in the scope
of this work. Nevertheless, evaluating the implementation against an
evaluation set of dependencies is necessary to ensure that the proposed
direction is not misleading.</p>
<h1 id="technical-conception"><em>deprec</em> | Technical
Conception</h1>
<p>This chapter goes in-depth about designing a software solution for
automated project-based end-of-support dependency detection –
<em>deprec</em>. Presented is its technical conception along with the
utilization of the <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> proposed in <a
href="#theoretic-basis" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="theoretic-basis">2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sboms">Working with Software Bills of Materials</h2>
<p><em>Deprec</em> has to handle different dependencies with differing
conditions. Be it what ecosystem they are developed for, or where and
how they are distributed. To be able to work with various dependencies
and to fulfill requirement , a common ground for dependencies was
needed. Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) were chosen as input of
<em>deprec</em>, to base the end-of-support dependency detection on.</p>
<p>SBOMs<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> are a standardized inventory of a
project’s components with information about the same, used in software
development and supply chain, asset and vulnerability management.
Focusing on dependencies, SBOMs provide information about the supplier,
name and version, unique identifier and relationships to other
dependencies (transitive dependencies).</p>
<p>Further, SBOMs operate ecosystem, language and platform independent,
suitable for <em>deprec</em>’s use case and functionality.
Conceptualizing <em>deprec</em> on top of SBOMs as input offers built-in
standardization and allows for achieving the requirement in full
length.</p>
<h3 id="eligible standard">Eligible Standard</h3>
<p>Since SBOMs in and of itself is solely a defined concept, different
standards exist. This section raises requirements for an eligible
standard and substantiates a suitable standard to be used for
<em>deprec</em> going forward:</p>
<h5 id="sbom:i">(i)</h5>
<p>Foremost, as SBOMs will function as input of <em>deprec</em>, the
same cannot be used without an SBOM at hand. Therefore, it has to be
easily possible to produce SBOMs for any given project. Following that,
the eligible SBOM standard requires offering various supported tools
accommodating different projects to be able to generate SBOMs for
them.</p>
<h5 id="ii">(ii)</h5>
<p>Moreover, since projects can utilize different versions and artifacts
of the same dependency, <em>deprec</em> needs unique and identifying
information associated with a dependency. <span id="sbom:ii"
label="sbom:ii"></span></p>
<h5 id="iii">(iii)</h5>
<p>Finally, the eligible implementation of a SBOM can provide a broad
information spectrum about a dependency to be leveraged to fetching
information from data sources. <span id="sbom:iii"
label="sbom:iii"></span></p>
<h5 id="the-software-package-data-exchange-spdx-standard">The Software
Package Data Exchange (SPDX) standard</h5>
<p><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, though satisfying the minimum SBOM
standard, is rather inconvenient for this use case. The leading idea of
SPDX, maintained by the Linux Foundation and its contributors, is to
enable data exchange of open-source dependency information. Information
about identification, due diligence, and analyses and resulting insights
that is rather performed independently by organizations, to be collected
and shared in a common format.</p>
<p>Elaborating further, SPDX does not offer easily readable data formats
such as JSON conveniently and is not conveniently to be integrated into
<em>deprec</em>. In addition, information provided<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
by the standard is not detailed and broad enough to be used to
satisfaction, missing fields like cryptographic hashes for distinct
artifacts.</p>
<h5 id="owasps-cyclonedx-standard">OWASP’s CycloneDX standard</h5>
<p><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, on the other hand, offers better
capabilities to be integrated into <em>deprec</em>. It focuses more on
security and vulnerabilities, providing information about dependency
identities themselves and less about exchange between entities. The
standard offers detailed and distinct information about dependencies,
such as dependency coordinates and the package URL<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>,
external references to version control systems, distributions and issue
trackers, or cryptographic hashes identifying specific dependencies’
artifacts. Moreover, officials and the community behind CycloneDX offer
broad tooling to produce and consume CycloneDX SBOMs for different
ecosystems.<br />
To summarize, CycloneDX fits the use case better than SPDX does. The
above stated requirements <strong></strong>, <strong></strong> and
<strong></strong> are achieved to satisfaction with CycloneDX’s SBOM
standard providing various identifiers, external references for more
information, and its established official and community support offering
various tooling.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-cyclonedx-sboms">Leveraging CycloneDX SBOMs</h3>
<p>As a follow-up on the previous <a href="#eligible standard"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eligible standard">4.1.1</a>,
CycloneDX’s SBOM standard is looked at in more detail how it can be
integrated into <em>deprec</em>. The main benefit of CycloneDX’s SBOMs,
in the context of <em>deprec</em>, is its capability to summarize a
project’s dependencies into identifiers that can then be leveraged into
fetching more information from various data sources. CycloneDX SBOMs
provide a variety of information, the example in <a
href="#lst:sbom-component" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="lst:sbom-component">[lst:sbom-component]</a> shows a
dependency and its information provided.<br />

<p>The Maven Central Search REST API<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, for example, allows

is among the most valuable reasons why the CycloneDX SBOMs standard was
chosen for <em>deprec</em>. Associating a dependency with, for example,
its repository, issue tracker or a distribution would certainly be
possible, but would be a hurdle to overcome. All three are important
sources of information, with the repository arguable being the most
important among them. The CycloneDX SBOM directly links to said sources
of information, to the advantage of <em>deprec</em>.</p>
<h2 id="extraction">Extracting Data</h2>
<p>To assess dependencies about their end-of-support status, data has to
be collected about a given dependency to obtain information about it, as
referenced in <a href="#fig:info-landscape"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:info-landscape">[fig:info-landscape]</a>. The
extraction phase, as the initial step of <em>deprec</em> towards the
assessment, collects data about a given dependency from various of its
available data origins.</p>
<p>Following that, keeping requirements and in mind, the extraction
phase must have a modular design. Therefore, the extraction phase is
split up to accommodate different <em>Extractors</em> with differing
internal logic according to their data origin, but all doing the same
thing: collecting data. Splitting the extraction phase into modular
<em>Extractors</em>, enables the extraction phase to function
independent of a particular dependency and to be expandable for more
data origins if needed.</p>
<p><a href="#fig:extraction" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:extraction">[fig:extraction]</a> depicts exemplarily
the extraction phase for a Maven dependency, showing example
<em>Extractors</em> for a vulnerability index, repository, and
distribution, alongside the exemplary data that can be collected from
the according data origin.</p>
<p><em>Extractors</em> depicted are, from top to bottom, extracting data
from the Sonatype OSS Index, GitHub repository, and Maven artifact index
via their according APIs. Though <em>Extractors</em> are not bound to be
consuming APIs, instead, <em>Extractors</em> can be implemented
independently according to their data origin and fetch data from it.</p>
<figure id="fig:extraction">
<img src="images/extraction-final.drawio.png" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption>Figure 5: <em>Deprec</em>: Extraction Phase</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="data-model">Data Model as Abstraction Layer</h2>
<p>Since different <em>Extractors</em> are used in the extraction phase
and these <em>Extractors</em> either collect different data or more or
less the same data only from other data origins, a common basis for
further use of the data is required. For example, extracting data from a
dependencies repository and its distribution results in different data.
The former gives, for example, data about commits, whereas the latter
gives, for example, data about a dependencies number of downloads.
Further, a given dependency can be developed on <a
href="https://github.com/"><em>github.com</em></a>, yet another on <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/"><em>sourceforge.net</em></a>. Both give
repository-related data, but both would require two distinct
<em>Extractors</em>.</p>
<p>The point is that, in order for <em>deprec</em> to achieve
requirement yet remain abstract and constant in further proceedings, a
data model is elaborated in which <em>Extractors</em> store their
extracted data. This data model functions as an abstraction layer
between the extraction phase and assessment of a dependency as
end-of-support.</p>
<p>To be noted, even though <a href="#fig:info-landscape"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:info-landscape">[fig:info-landscape]</a> is
referenced in <a href="#extraction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="extraction">4.2</a>, it is to be differentiated from the
data model elaborated in this section. The former divides the landscape
of information into domains of informational value, while the latter
reflects data extracted in an abstracted and unifying form.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="structural-design">Structural Design</h3>
<p>The structural design of the data model is aligned with the data
origins from which the <em>Extractors</em> extract their data. The <a
href="#appendix:data-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="appendix:data-model">8</a> contains the data model
depicting different data fields, though with a depth of one. By depth is
meant that, for example, <em>Organization</em> listed under
<em>Repository</em> would contain further information such as
collaborators within the organizations, the organizations repositories
or their sponsors. For reasons of space and clarity, deeper going data
has been omitted.</p>
<p>Important for the data model is that it can be expanded if one were
to extend data origins that would require data of their own. At the time
of this work, the following data source origins are listed:
<em>Repository</em>, <em>Distribution</em> and <em>Vulnerability
Index</em>. Further, the fields listed are designed by considering, in
order in which they were listed, <a
href="https://github.com/"><em>github.com</em></a>, <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com/"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a> and <a
href="https://ossindex.sonatype.org/"><em>ossindex.sonatype.org</em></a>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="detailing-fields">Detailing Fields</h3>
<p>Considering fields for <em>Repository</em>, one notices more or less
resemblance to data found on <a
href="https://github.com/"><em>github.com</em></a>. It is set this way
deliberately, as GitHub repositories represent the vast majority of
where open-source software is developed <span class="citation"
data-cites="wp_octoverse_2022">(<span>“Octoverse 2022: <span>The</span>
State of Open Source”</span> n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p>Elaborating further, <em>Distribution</em> is split into
<em>Library</em> and <em>Dependency</em>. This has the background that
information on distributions can be specific about a dependencies
version, as well as general across all versions. Considering <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com/"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a>, it
provides numbers of downloads about a dependency summed across all its
versions, as well as numbers of downloads for a specific version. The
distinction helps to make more accurate statements, for example, between
the popularity of a dependency and the popularity of a particular
version of it.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-framework">Integrating the <em>EOS Abstraction

<p>With data extracted and refurbished, this section describes the
integration of the <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> proposed in <a

<h3 id="leveraging-data-into-signals-and-metrics">Leveraging Data into

verifying if <em>Vulnerabilities</em> has any vulnerabilities listed;
<strong>S3</strong> can be assessed by comparing the timestamp of

<h5 id="metrics-1">Metrics</h5>
<p>are handled in the way that extracted data is turned into fitting a

license is; <strong>M3</strong> can be measured by analyzing the
release’s content and what changes were released, for example, whether
features are added or not.</p>
<p>To be noted, <em>Metrics</em>, when converted from extracted data,
apart from <em>Signals</em>, have to be interpreted further, for
example, by comparison against a given threshold.</p>
<h3 id="eval-statements">Evaluating <em>Statements</em>: Distributing
<em>Points</em></h3>
<p>To evaluate <em>Statements</em> listed in <a href="#sec:statements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:statements">2.3.2</a>,
corresponding <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em> are utilized and
evaluated based on the informative value they carry.</p>
<p>Given the example of the <em>Statement</em> <em>Backup</em>,
utilizing <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em> such as:
<strong>(a)</strong> repository is backed up by organization; and
<strong>(b)</strong> average organizations per contributor. Though
<strong>(a)</strong> and <strong>(b)</strong> carrying informative value
and being independently evaluative, they cannot be evaluated manageable
in combination. Evaluating <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
<em>Signals</em>, in combination, would result in <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> different combinations. If
<em>Metrics</em> are added, it becomes even more unwieldy. To conclude,
for <em>Backup</em> to be evaluated based on <strong>(a)</strong>
<em><strong>and</strong></em> <strong>(b)</strong>, a unifying basis for
the evaluation of <em>Statements</em> is necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, the evaluation of <em>Statements</em> utilizing
<em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em> is carried out as follows:
<em>Statements</em> are evaluated by evaluating <em>Signals</em> and
<em>Metrics</em>, with which in turn are <em>Points</em> distributed
according to whether they favor the <em>Statement</em> regarding its
statement, thus indicating about the end-of-support status. Whereby
<em>Points</em> can be distributed into binary categories such as ’in
favor of EOS’ and ’not in favor of EOS’, or the like. Though,
distributing <em>Points</em> in more sophisticated and fine-grained
categories is also possible. Overcoming the above exponential problem,
the approach of distributing <em>Points</em> breaks possible results
down to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> categories for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em>.
In addition, how many <em>Points</em> a given <em>Signal</em> or
<em>Metric</em> distributes can be decided in relation to other
<em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em> or individually, depending on the
<em>Signal</em> or <em>Metric</em>.</p>
<p>In the given example of <em>Backup</em>, this means that evaluating
<strong>(a)</strong> would distribute <em>Points</em> based on if
<strong>(a)</strong> independently favors <em>Backup</em> regarding
strength of a dependencies backup. If the repository is backed by an
organization, <strong>(a)</strong> would indicate in favor of
<em>Backup</em> thus contraindicating end-of-support, and
<em>Points</em> would be distributed into the according category. The
same would take place for <strong>(b)</strong>. Finally, a distribution
of <em>Points</em> can be interpreted as the evaluation of
<em>Backup</em> based on utilized <em>Signals</em> and
<em>Metrics</em>.</p>
<h4 id="data-independence">Data Independence</h4>
<p>Regarding the requirement of , the approach of distributing
<em>Points</em> has the advantage that if more <em>Signals</em> or
<em>Metrics</em> are to be evaluated for a given <em>Statement</em>,
they can be added without interfering with other <em>Signals</em> or
<em>Metrics</em>. The same applies for missing data, it can be ignored
and does not affect the Statement. If data is missing, no
<em>Points</em> are distributed. Though, the informative strength of the
<em>Statement</em> decreases the more data is missing.</p>
<h3 id="statements-into-afs">Adapting <em>Statements</em> into <em>EOS
Factors</em></h3>
<p>To evaluate <em>EOS Factors</em> described in <a href="#eos-afs"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eos-afs">2.3.3</a>,
corresponding <em>Statements</em> listed in the same are combined and
adapted into a given <em>EOS Factor</em>. The combination of
<em>Statements</em> works on the same basis when evaluating
<em>Statements</em> as described in <a href="#eval-statements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eval-statements">4.4.2</a>:
<em>Points</em> distributed by <em>Statements</em> are taken over into a
given <em>EOS Factor</em>, resulting in a composite distribution of
<em>Points</em> to categories by a collection of <em>Statements</em>.
Though <em>EOS Factors</em> would inevitably also take over categories
from their <em>Statements</em>, they would function nonetheless the same
for <em>EOS Factors</em>, as given the example of ’in favor of EOS’ and
’not in favor of EOS’. In addition, <em>Points</em> taken over from a
<em>Statement</em> can be weighted additionally to set the
<em>Statement</em> in relation to other <em>Statements</em>.</p>
<p>Consequential to the adoption of <em>Statements</em> into <em>EOS
Factors</em> would be the preceding definition of categories that
<em>Points</em> are distributed to, which would be applied in all
<em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> consistently.</p>
<h2 id="combcon">Combination and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following the integration of the <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em>
and evaluation of <em>EOS Factors</em>, both are utilized to assess
dependencies as end-of-support. As the <em>EOS Abstraction
Framework</em> ends with <em>EOS Factors</em>, following, the
combination of the latter among themselves and subsequently conclusions
drawn from combining <em>EOS Factors</em> is described.</p>
<h3 id="combining-eos-factors">Combining <em>EOS Factors</em></h3>
<p>describes that <em>EOS Factors</em> take over and composite
<em>Points</em> distributed by their corresponding <em>Statements</em>.
Therefore, the evaluation of a particular <em>EOS Factor</em> is in the
form of distributed <em>Points</em> to categories. For combining <em>EOS
Factors</em>, the same can be done: <em>Points</em> taken over by
<em>EOS Factors</em> from their <em>Statements</em> can be composited to
form a final composited distribution of <em>Points</em>. This final
distribution of <em>Points</em> to categories represents the
classification of a given dependency as end-of-support.</p>
<p>Given example categories such as ’in favor of EOS’ and ’not in favor
of EOS’, the final distribution would result whether data extracted and
information utilized favors a dependency being classified as
end-of-support, and thus, whether the dependency is classified as
end-of-support.</p>
<h4 id="interconnections">Interconnections</h4>
<p>When combining <em>EOS Factors</em>, <em>Deity-Given</em> acts as a
preliminary factor to all other factors. <em>Effort</em> and
<em>Support</em> share the higher position in relation to remaining
<em>EOS Factors</em>, as the two describe the ’as is’ aspect of a
dependency. Coming in second, <em>Interconnectedness</em> and
<em>Community</em> enable the ’going forward’ aspect to be extrapolated.
<em>Circumstances</em> and <em>Ecosystem</em> are apart from the above,
and give indications separately. Following that, the combination of
<em>EOS Factors</em> has to consider these aspects and prioritize
<em>EOS Factors</em> accordingly. As the combination of <em>EOS
Factors</em> results in a composite distribution of <em>Points</em>,
<em>EOS Factors</em> can be weighted accordingly when their distributed
<em>Points</em> are added to the final composition.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-conclusions">Drawing Conclusions</h3>
<p>With the result of the combination of <em>EOS Factors</em>, and
therefore the classification of dependencies as end-of-support, being a
distribution of <em>Points</em>, conclusions drawn are based on the
same. To enhance the result in terms of usability, a customized
normalization function<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> can be applied to the distribution
resulting in probabilities. Given the example of <strong>(a)</strong>
’in favor of EOS’ and <strong>(b)</strong> ’not in favor of EOS’.
<em>Points</em> distributed are transformed, for example, to form the
result of a dependency being end-of-support to a percentage of 76%,
i.e., <span class="math inline">\(a \hat{=} 0.76\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b \hat{=} 0.24\)</span>.</p>
<p>Further, disclosed as the result of the classification of a
dependency as end-of-support is not the category with the highest
probability of all. Instead, disclosed are all categories with their
according probability. The use of disclosing all categories with their
probability is far greater than to only disclosing the category with the
highest probability as a result. Given the example of two categories, a
given distribution of <em>Points</em>, though extreme, could result in
percentages such as <span class="math inline">\(49/51\)</span>.
Disclosing all of them as the result of the classification assures that
information is not lost. How to interpret the information and act upon,
however, is up to the user.</p>
<h2 id="agent">Agent-based Processing</h2>
<p>The process described from <a href="#extraction"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="extraction">[extraction]</a> all the way to <a
href="#combcon" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="combcon">[combcon]</a> has to be executed for each
dependency independently. Therefore, <em>deprec</em> works upon an
agent-based framework, where each dependency is handled by an
<em>Agent</em>: from extracting data, to evaluating <em>Statements</em>
and <em>EOS Factors</em>, combining the latter and concluding about a
dependencies end-of-support status.</p>
<p>Within <em>deprec</em>, <em>Agents</em> are created and dependencies
are assigned for processing. <a href="#fig:agent"
data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:agent">[fig:agent]</a>
represents the internal logic of <em>Agents</em> and is modelled on the
sections described hereinbefore. <em>Agents</em> receive dependencies
with their metadata extracted from the SBOM, which <em>deprec</em>
receives as input prior, and perform the extraction phase with
<em>Extractors</em> according to their dependency. Finished
<em>Extractors</em> enter their extracted data into the data model, with
which <em>Agents</em> evaluate <em>Statements</em> and thus <em>EOS
Factors</em>. This is followed by the phase of <em>Combination and
Conclusion</em>, in which <em>Agents</em> combine <em>EOS Factors</em>
and a final distribution of <em>Points</em> is composed. As a result,
<em>Agents</em> return the distribution of <em>Points</em>, which is
converted into probabilities for classifying their respective
dependency.</p>

Factors</em> is implemented. Further, describing how <em>deprec</em> can
be used in practice and its limitations occurred during implementation
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="impl-gc">Specific Conditions</h2>
<p>The following are general conditions with which the implementation of
<em>deprec</em> was accomplished. They pose leading implementation
decisions which are specific to the implementation within this work to
specifically foster <a href="#gc-and-uc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="gc-and-uc">3.1</a>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="development-environment">Development
Environment</h3>
<p><em>Deprec</em> was implemented using the Go programming language<a
href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. The implementation of the
extraction phase of <em>deprec</em> sets itself within web development
due to data extracted being foremost fetched by consuming APIs.
Furthermore, due to the agent-based framework described in <a
href="#agent" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="agent">4.6</a>,
performance and concurrency play a role. Lastly, considering requirement
, <em>deprec</em> can be implemented, for example as a command line
interface tool or service.</p>
<p>Following that, the Go programming language is suitable for
development within the web environment to consume APIs. Further, Go is
popular for backend purposes within a service, as well as suitable for
developing a command line interface tool. Concerning performance and
concurrency, Go enables to handle both reliably with its <em>go
routines</em>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="github-repositories">GitHub Repositories</h3>
<p>Since, among open-source projects, <a
href="https://github.com/"><em>github.com</em></a> presents the most
popular place to develop and collaborate, further <em>Extractors</em>
apart from the one for <a
href="https://github.com/"><em>github.com</em></a> repositories were not
considered for initial implementation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="maven-ecosystem">Maven Ecosystem</h3>
<p>In unison with <a href="#gc-and-uc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="gc-and-uc">3.1</a>, the implementation of
<em>deprec</em> is foremost concentrated on detecting end-of-support
dependencies within the Maven ecosystem. Following that, the extraction
phase implemented concentrates on <em>Extractors</em> for data origins
of dependencies within the Maven ecosystem. Therefore, data origins for
information explicit about Maven dependencies that come in question are
either <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com/"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a> or <a
href="https://search.maven.org/"><em>search.maven.org</em></a>. Data
available is more or less similar on both sources, but more detailed and
approachable in the former. The former though offers no official
approach on accessing available data on it. Due to <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a> not
enabling access to their provided data without unofficial
implementation-heavy and time-consuming web scraping as an alternative,
the latter was settled with for initial implementation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-integration">Continuous
Integration</h3>
<p>Following <a href="#gc-and-uc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="gc-and-uc">3.1</a>, the foremost use in practice for
<em>deprec</em> will be inside continuous integration pipelines. Device
Insight utilizes GitLab pipelines<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> for continuous
integration, therefore, the initial integration of <em>deprec</em> is
implemented foremost with this circumstance in mind.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="4-cat"><em>Points</em> Distribution
Categories</h3>
<p>When evaluating <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em>,
<em>Points</em> as described in <a href="#eval-statements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eval-statements">4.4.2</a> are
distributed to categories. Before starting the implementation of
<em>deprec</em>, such categories have to be defined to evaluate
<em>Statements</em> and therefore <em>EOS Factors</em>, which in turn
represent the classification result of a dependency (see <a
href="#fig:agent" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:agent">[fig:agent]</a>) and are returned as output
of <em>deprec</em> (see <a href="#fig:top-level"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:top-level">[fig:top-level]</a>).</p>
<p>Due to <em>deprec</em> having its use case within dependency
management, detecting end-of-support dependencies within a project
serves as a prophylaxis to minimize risks and expenses due to
problematic dependencies. Classifying dependencies strictly without
margin as either end-of-support or not, would result in an overly strict
view on dependency end-of-support status, which does not reflect the
actual landscape of dependencies. Following that, choosing two
categories such as ’in favor of EOS’ and ’not in favor of EOS’ does not
benefit the use within dependency management. Instead, dividing
categories which <em>Points</em> are distributed to more granular, the
following four categories are proposed: <strong>No Concerns
(NC)</strong>, <strong>No Immediate Action (NIA)</strong>,
<strong>Watchlist (W)</strong> and <strong>Decision Making
(DM)</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, the former two represent the ’not in favor of EOS’
fraction, whereas the latter two represent the ’in favor of EOS’
fraction. What differentiates <strong>NC</strong> and
<strong>NIA</strong> from <strong>W</strong> and <strong>DM</strong> is
the consequence if action has to be taken regarding a given dependency.
The difference between <strong>NC</strong> and <strong>NIA</strong> lies
within whether action is likely to be necessary, but not within the
current situation the dependency is at. Separating <strong>W</strong>
and <strong>DM</strong> is that dependencies classified as the former
present a higher risk of consequences of end-of-support dependencies and
should be kept in check. Whereas, action to be taken is recommended for
dependencies classified as the latter.</p>
<h2 id="extraction-phase">Extraction Phase</h2>
<p>Implementing the extraction phase of <em>deprec</em> consisted of
implementing <em>Extractors</em> for selected data origins. Concerning
this section are insights about how APIs were consumed and why their
responses were cached.</p>
<h3 id="consuming-apis">Consuming APIs</h3>
<h4 id="github-api">GitHub API</h4>
<p>The GitHub API provides two different API endpoints to fetch data
from, one being its REST API<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> and the other its
GraphQL API<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Extractor</em> implemented was foremost focused on extracting
data from the GitHub REST API. The reasoning was that fetching data via
the REST API was more convenient and quicker to implement to achieve
fast prototyping and iterative development. Data from the REST API
endpoint included commits, issues, releases, and tags for a repository
as well as general information about the repository and its
contributors. Accessing the GitHub REST API using the Go programming
language was achieved by using its existing client for it<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Though, implementing the <em>Extractor</em> to additionally consume
the GraphQL API endpoint was done so on a test basis and for a single
and limited purpose. One particular endpoint was more profitable
consumed via the GraphQL endpoint than via the REST API. In detail,
fetching additional information about a repositories contributors:
fetched via the REST API would require <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> API requests, fetched via GraphQL, only
one API request is required. Similar to the GitHub REST API, its
existing client<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> for the Go programming language was
utilized to access the GitHub GraphQL API.</p>
<h4 id="sonatype-oss-index-rest-api">Sonatype OSS Index REST API</h4>
<p>Implementing an <em>Extractor</em> consuming the Sonatype OSS Index
REST API was done via utilizing an existing client<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
for the API.</p>
<p>Data fetched was foremost about numbers of vulnerabilities of a
dependency. The API provides further and more detailed information about
given vulnerabilities, though was not utilized. <em>Deprec</em>
providing further insights into given vulnerabilities if a dependency
had any was not considered.</p>
<h4 id="maven-central-search-rest-api">Maven Central Search REST
API</h4>
<p>Consuming the Maven Central Search REST API implemented within its
<em>Extractor</em> posed the difficulty that no existing client existed
yet. Therefore, consuming the API was done so with a lightweight basic
client written for this <em>Extractor</em>. It enables to fetch data
about dependencies identified via SHA-1 hashes across their versions, as
well as artifacts specific to a dependencies’ version.</p>
<h3 id="caching-api-responses">Caching API Responses</h3>
<p>Consuming the GitHub REST API subdues a rate limit of 5000 requests
per hour<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>, which had to be handled within the
according <em>Extractor</em>. Initially, to counteract the rate limit
and to achieve proper development capabilities without having to consume
the same API endpoints repeatedly, caching was implemented into
consuming APIs from the get go. During development, caching API
responses enabled faster repeatability of testing <em>deprec</em> and
fostered faster iterations while developing the same.</p>
<p>In addition, implementing caching into the consumption of APIs avoids
redundancy of the same data being fetched from the same endpoint on two
different occasions. Especially critical for <em>deprec</em> and its
performance, for example, are dependencies that are developed within the
same repository. Dependencies developed in such a repository, also
referred to as monorepo, would have the same external reference listed
as their repository in an SBOM. Without caching, the <em>Extractor</em>
would extract the same data from the same repository over and over.</p>
<p>The cache was implemented as a layer wrapping API clients consuming
their according APIs. To store cached data, a MongoDB<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
was chosen, and the following schema applied: each API endpoint had its
database, which within documents, i.e., JSON objects, were stored that
represented a specific request to the given API endpoint. For example,
consuming the GitHub REST API to list contributors of the ’reactjs’
repository resulted in a document named ’reactjs’ listing contributors,
being added into the ’repository_list_contributors’ database.</p>
<p>To keep the database upkeep simple, API responses were stored into
their database as is, without modification. MongoDB and its Go Driver<a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> enabled the caching of unaltered
API responses conveniently and natively without interference, which was
the main reason why MongoDB was chosen.</p>
<h2 id="cores"><em>Cores</em> Data Structure</h2>
<p><em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> both rely on the concept
of distributing points proposed in <a href="#eval-statements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eval-statements">4.4.2</a>.
The key difference being that <em>Statements</em> distribute points by
evaluating <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em>, whereas <em>EOS
Factors</em> take over <em>Points</em> distributed by
<em>Statements</em>. Therefore, both can be implemented by the same data
structure for ease of use: <em>Cores</em>. A <em>Core</em> is a data
structure which facilitates the distribution of <em>Points</em> to
categories by either interpreting <em>Signals</em> or <em>Metrics</em>,
or taking over distributed <em>Points</em> from other
<em>Cores</em>.</p>

<p><a href="#lst:cores-struct" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="lst:cores-struct">[lst:cores-struct]</a> depicts the
simplified Golang struct alongside its two <em>intake</em> and
<em>overtake</em> methods. Differentiated by its <em>Name</em>, a
<em>Core</em> has four categories according to <a href="#4-cat"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="4-cat">[4-cat]</a> which
<em>Points</em> can be distributed to. Categories and <em>Points</em>
distributed to them are represented as float, with each <em>Point</em>
being added, incrementing the float value.</p>
<p><em>Core</em> function <em>intake</em> takes in a float as
<em>value</em> and distributes <em>Points</em> depending on the value
taken in. Following that, values from <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> taken in are interpreted in intervals
of <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> starting with
<em>Points</em> being distributed to <em>Decision Making</em> for values
strictly less than <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> and so on.
The <em>weight</em> parameter taken in additionally controls the number
of <em>Points</em> which are distributed to the according category. On
one hand, <em>Signals</em>, due to their ’yes’ or ’no’ philosophy,
depending on which category they distribute <em>Points</em> to, can be
represented as either <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(0.75\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. <em>Metrics</em>, on the other hand,
due to being continuous, when being evaluated, have to be normalized
between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> beforehand.</p>
<p><em>Core</em> function <em>overtake</em>, takes in another
<em>Core</em> and takes over its distributed <em>Points</em>, which can
be additionally weighted by the <em>weight</em> parameter.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="normalizing-overtake">Normalizing
<em>overtake</em></h3>
<p>When taking over <em>Points</em> from other <em>Cores</em>, it was
necessary to normalize distributed <em>Points</em> before taking them
over. Reasoning was that <em>Points</em> distributed by <em>intake</em>
for the same <em>Core</em> can be weighted and set in relation with each
other within the context of that <em>Core</em>. Taking over
<em>Points</em> from a <em>Core</em> has to be done without also
carrying over internal weights from that <em>Core</em>. In addition,
normalizing <em>Cores</em> before takeover, enables to take over
multiple <em>Cores</em> set in relation to each other by weights,
without weights of underlying <em>Cores</em> to interfere.</p>
<h2 id="selected-statements-and-eos-factors">Selected
<em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em></h2>
<p>On the base of information in <a href="#sec:def-information"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:def-information">2.3.1</a>
and definitions of <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em>,
following the concept of the same described in <a
href="#integrating-framework" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="integrating-framework">4.4</a>, <em>Statements</em> and
<em>EOS Factors</em> are implemented. To be noted, only few
<em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> are looked upon in detail,
which were chosen in such a way as to represent the widest possible
range of implemented evaluation functionality.</p>
<p>This chapter provides detailed insights into how extracted data is
turned into <em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em>, and how the same are
evaluated and combined to distribute <em>Points</em> to categories to
evaluate <em>Statements</em>. Furthermore, detailing how
<em>Statements</em> are combined into <em>EOS Factors</em>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-difficulties">Implementation Difficulties</h3>
<p>Within the scope of this work, not all <em>EOS Factors</em> were
implemented to their fullest capabilities. <a
href="#fig:afs-implemented" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:afs-implemented">[fig:afs-implemented]</a> depicts
the current state of implementation as of this work. Some
<em>Statements</em> were less feasible than others, with higher cost of
implementation associated. Their implementation would involve a
disproportionately high effort to achieve their fullest.</p>
<p><em>Marking</em>, for example, was implemented as basic key-word
comparison. It would be possible to be implemented in a much more
complex way, for example, to cover the broadest of details whether a
repositories README contains information about the dependencies’ status.
Given the repository ’RxJava’<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>, its README contains
end-of-life notices for versions <span
class="math inline">\(1.x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(2.x\)</span>. To associate the end-of-life notice
with only versions <span class="math inline">\(2.x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1.x\)</span> without doing so for versions <span
class="math inline">\(3.x\)</span> requires techniques that go beyond
key-word comparison.</p>
<p><em>Downstream</em> and <em>Upstream</em> would each require analysis
of additional dependencies for each focal dependency. <em>Impact</em>
requires analyzing each commit to compute its impact. Implementing the
three <em>Statements</em>, though possible, would add complexity not
worth the effort for initial implementation, which is why they were not
considered.</p>
<p><em>LTS</em> would require profound analysis to match commits for
security or vulnerability patches and whether these commits were checked
into previous releases. Though it would amount to verify if releases
have been re-released, analyzing descriptions and content of releases
whether they specify or reveal that vulnerabilities have been back
ported. <em>LTS</em> was among other <em>Statements</em> the most
difficult to find a proper approach for implementation, which is why
<em>LTS</em> was not considered for initial implementation.<br />
The advantage of the <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em> though is that
there is no mandatory dependence on individual <em>Statements</em> to
perform the classification. Be it all <em>Statements</em> or a single
one, the classification would function anyway, though with more room for
inaccuracy, the fewer <em>Statements</em> that could be used.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 9: Implemented <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS
Factors</em> — Non-implemented are sketched out</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="continuous-evaluation">Continuous Evaluation</h3>
<p>While implementing <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em>, the
implementation was continuously evaluated and parameter-tuned based on a
dependency collection<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> representing the evaluation set
mentioned in requirement . Dependencies were collected throughout the
time span of this work and subjectively assessed and classified as one
of the four categories described in <a href="#impl-gc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a>.</p>
<h3 id="impl-statements"><em>Statements</em></h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="activity-1">Activity</h4>
<p>Implementing <em>Activity</em> evaluates whether repository activity
contraindicates end-of-support. Using commits, releases, and issues,
they were subjected to a statistical analysis. To be noted, further
explanations are given using commits, but the former are also applied to
releases and issues, wich are evaluated the same. Though, commits and
releases are weighted heavier than issues.</p>
<p>The difficulty of evaluating if recent commit activity being
sufficient is that commit activity cannot be compared against an
arbitrary value. Such an arbitrary value, how much activity would be
sufficient, would vary from project to project, as well as change
dynamically from time to time depending on a project’s current stage.
Instead, recent commit activity is compared against its timeline, i.e.,
past commit activity. Meaning by that, for example, commit activity in
the past two months is compared against commit activity of the last six
months up to the past two months.<br />
In preparation, three distinct targets are computed, visualized in <a
href="#fig:activity-viz" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:activity-viz">[fig:activity-viz]</a>:
<strong>I</strong> Having the history of commits and their timestamps,
they were grouped by month and a monthly average <span
class="math inline">\(AVG\)</span> was computed; <strong>II</strong>
following that, the monthly commit timeline is split into <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sections of equal size, i.e.,
percentiles <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>;
<strong>III</strong> further, grouping all monthly commits for each
percentile <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, an average <span
class="math inline">\(P_{n,AVG}\)</span> for each percentile <span
class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> was computed.</p>
<figure id="fig:activity-viz">
<img src="images/activity-example.drawio.png" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption>Figure 10: <em>Activity</em> Computing Targets</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using <strong>I</strong>, <strong>II</strong> and
<strong>III</strong>, the first <em>Metric</em> for <em>Activity</em>
was computed with <a href="#LPA-Over-SPA" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="LPA-Over-SPA">[LPA-Over-SPA]</a>. Arguing that activity
is at its highest around a projects’ growth stage <span class="citation"
data-cites="wang_survival_2012">(J. Wang 2012, 356)</span>, comparing
recent commit activity against a repositories’ commit activity at growth
stage places the former in relation. Dividing the commit timeline into
five sections, i.e., 20 percentiles, the growth stage most likely lies
within the first half of the timeline. Therefore, <a
href="#LPA-Over-SPA" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="LPA-Over-SPA">[LPA-Over-SPA]</a> evaluates the last 20
percent of commits in relation to the second 20 percent of commits.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{LPA-Over-SPA}
    recent\ activity\ to\ growth =
\frac{P_{5,AVG}}{P_{2,AVG}}\]</span></p>
<p>Elaborating further, the second <em>Metric</em> for <em>Activity</em>
was computed with <a href="#LPA-Over-AVG" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="LPA-Over-AVG">[LPA-Over-AVG]</a>. Again, the commit
timeline is divided into percentiles of 20. Contrary to <a
href="#LPA-Over-SPA" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="LPA-Over-SPA">[LPA-Over-SPA]</a>, <a
href="#LPA-Over-AVG" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="LPA-Over-AVG">[LPA-Over-AVG]</a> compares recent commit
activity against the repositories average commit activity over all its
timeline.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{LPA-Over-AVG}
     recent\ activity\ to\ average = \frac{P_{5,AVG}}{AVG}\]</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="recentness-1">Recentness</h4>
<p>Given whether a repository was updated recently, <em>Recentness</em>
is evaluated by comparing latest commits and releases against limits.
Limits, in this case, represent the maximum number of months accepted
since the last activity, which were set as 24 months and four months
respectively. Due to repositories receiving commits without necessarily
having produced a release, the former is weighted heavier than the
latter.</p>
<p>To evaluate recency of commits, the <em>Metric</em> of months passed
since the repositories single latest commit is computed and set against
its given limit. Given the commit timeline of the ’log4j1’ repository<a
href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> for example, the repository
received outlier commits long after its end-of-life notice. Comparing
the single latest commit isolated, would implicate recency and
negatively influence the evaluation, leading it astray. Therefore, in
addition, the average months past since committed of the latest two
percent of commits collected is computed as <em>Metric</em> and also
compared against the same limit. To be noted, the latter <em>Metric</em>
is weighted heavier than the former.</p>
<p>Evaluating recency of releases, computing months passed since the
repositories latest release as <em>Metric</em> and comparing it against
its given limit is sufficient.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="processing-1">Processing</h4>
<p>The core of <em>Processing</em> is efficiency of issue handling. To
measure it, the target <em>Metric</em> of <em>burn</em> using <a
href="#burn" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="burn">[burn]</a> was computed for each month of the
repository issue timeline. <em>Burn</em> represents the efficiency with
which a repository processes (closes) their issues. Low <em>burn</em> in
a month indicates that a repository received more issues than it could
process, with high <em>burn</em> indicating that a repository managed to
keep their issue numbers at bay, able to close more issues than it
received.</p>
<p>Though <em>burn</em> represents the efficiency with which a
repository processes issues, it cannot be used to evaluate
<em>Processing</em> yet, further computing is necessary. To evaluate
<em>Processing</em>, the <em>burn</em> timeline was evaluated with the
same principles depicted in <a href="#fig:activity-viz"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:activity-viz">[fig:activity-viz]</a>. The timeline
is split into five sections, i.e., 20 percentiles. Similar to
<em>Activity</em>, recent <em>burn</em> was evaluated in relation to the
timelines total average <em>burn</em> and the <em>burn</em> of the
repository at its growth stage.</p>
<p>In addition to utilizing <em>burn</em>, the average closing time of
issues was computed and compared against the given limit of two
months.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{burn}
     burn = \frac{closed\ issues}{opened\ issues}\]</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="backup-1">Backup</h4>
<p>Implementing <em>Backup</em> as to how much a dependency is backed
up, the following <em>Metrics</em> are cumulated and compared against
given thresholds: contributor companies, contributor organizations and
contributor sponsors. In addition, the <em>Signal</em> of whether the
repository is backed by an organization was used, which is weighted
heavier than all other <em>Metrics</em> in the evaluation.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="network-1">Network</h4>
<p>Evaluating <em>Network</em> amounts to cumulating outgoing
connections of a dependency and its repository to measure how networked
a dependency is. Achieved by cumulating different numerical aspects of a
dependency and its repository: contributor repositories and
organizations, and collaborators, repositories and followers within the
organization of a repository. The accumulation was then compared to a
given threshold.</p>
<h3 id="impl-eos"><em>EOS Factors</em></h3>
<p>The evaluation functionality of distinct <em>EOS Factors</em> boils
down to trade-off of their according <em>Statements</em>. Considering
<em>Circumstances</em>, it is intentionally designed to be the category
of everything else. The trade-off of <em>Statements</em> within
<em>Circumstance</em> is rather simple, weighting contextual different
<em>Statements</em> is difficult doing it logical sound. Therefore, all
<em>Statements</em> in <em>Circumstance</em> are evenly weighted. Other
than <em>Circumstance</em>, all <em>EOS Factors</em> weight their
<em>Statements</em> based on the results received on the evaluation set.
<em>Effort</em>, for example, weights <em>Recentness</em> heavier than
<em>Activity</em> and <em>Core Team</em>. Giving definitive answers,
though, as to how to weight different <em>Statements</em> within <em>EOS
Factors</em> is hard to achieve, but could be subject to further
research.</p>
<p>Elaborating further, <a href="#combcon" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="combcon">4.5</a> describes that <em>EOS Factors</em>
among themselves are combined to composite the final distribution of
<em>Points</em> representing the classification of a dependency as
end-of-support. The evaluation functionality of this aspect is
implemented the same as just described, trade-off of all seven <em>EOS
Factors</em>. <em>Effort</em> and <em>Support</em>, following <a
href="#interconnections" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="interconnections">4.5.1.1</a>, are weighted heaviest,
followed by <em>Community</em> and <em>Interconnectedness</em>, with
<em>Ecosystem</em> and <em>Circumstances</em> being weight the lightest.
Whereas <em>Deity-Given</em>, serving a preliminary function, is
weighted in such a way that it can determine the result independently of
all others. Though, here again, giving definitive weights is hard to
achieve, but could be subject to further research.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Enabling Configuration</h3>
<p>Limits, percentages, weights and thresholds mentioned throughout the
explanation of evaluating <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em>
hereinbefore were not chosen arbitrarily. The determination of these
values is based on continuous evaluation with the aforementioned
evaluation set. Limits, percentages, weights, and thresholds presented
were the ones achieving the best results against the evaluation set by
manual testing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for the use of <em>deprec</em> going forward, the
implementation of evaluating <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS
Factors</em> is enabled to be configured using a separate configuration
file. With which limits, percentages, weights, and thresholds used
throughout the implementation can be configured to control and tune the
evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="separating-functionality-from-application">Separating

<p>The technical conception presented in <a href="#technical-conception"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="technical-conception">4</a>
and implementation described hereinbefore does not entail details of the
practical usage of <em>deprec</em> and how it can be utilized from a
user standpoint within pre-existing workflows and infrastructure. Done
so with intention, the functionality of <em>deprec</em>, i.e.,
project-based dependency end-of-support detection, is split from its
application. To achieve requirement , separating functionality from
application enabled the former to be implemented to fit different

<p>The core of <em>deprec-cli</em> is that it wraps <em>deprec</em>, it
handles input, output, and configuration details via the command line
such as decoding SBOM files, writing to an output file or handling the

<h6 id="runmode">runMode</h6>
<p>representing the mode in which <em>deprec</em> creates and runs
<em>Agents</em>. On one hand, <em>linear</em> meaning that one
<em>Agent</em> after another other is created and run, resulting in
linear processing of dependencies. On the other hand, <em>parallel</em>
lets <em>deprec</em> create and run <em>Agents</em> concurrently.</p>
<h6 id="workers">workers</h6>
<p>representing the number of workers that, if run in parallel, can be
run to analyze dependencies concurrently. Meaning, by that, the number
of <em>Agents</em> that can be created and run concurrently.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p><em>Deprec</em> implemented within this work subdues three
consequential limitations by design decisions made in <a
href="#technical-conception" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="technical-conception">4</a> and <a href="#impl-gc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="github-api-rate-limits">GitHub API Rate
Limits</h3>
<p>For one, <em>deprec</em>’s extraction phase, specifically the GitHub
<em>Extractor</em>, is limited in its capabilities by the REST APIs
internal rate limit of 5000 requests per hour. This has the effect of
limiting the throughput with which dependencies can be classified. In an
extreme case, projects with numerous dependencies, which in turn have a
lot of data to be fetched, may bump up against the rate limit without
<em>deprec</em> being able to classify all dependencies. Sonatype OSS
Index and Maven Central, as far as concerned within this work and
consumed by <em>deprec</em>, do not impose limitations on API requests
that would substantially restrict <em>deprec</em>’s capabilities.</p>
<p>A partial solution to this situation would be to split data extracted
between GitHub’s REST and GraphQL API. Partially, as GitHub’s GraphQL
API also imposes rate limits<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>. To fully substitute
the REST API with its GraphQL pendant is not possible, as rate limits on
the latter are calculated to counteract the greater capabilities of
GraphQL compared to REST and are not based on number of requests.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="maven-central">Maven Central</h3>
<p>Mentioned in <a href="#impl-gc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a> is that the Maven ecosystem offers two
distinct data origins. Suitable for integration, though, was only one of
the two. The hoped-for benefit of rich information that <a
href="https://mvnrepository.com"><em>mvnrepository.com</em></a> would
provide could not be entirely derived from <a
href="https://search.maven.org"><em>search.maven.org</em></a>. For
example, the former provides detailed key figures for the use of a
dependency in other dependencies of the Maven ecosystem. The same could
not be achieved for the latter. Similar situations were the case for
information or key figures such as ranking among categories or domains,
vulnerabilities, and dependents. Following that, <em>Statements</em>
such as <em>Popularity</em> or <em>Rivalry</em> that would benefit from
the just mentioned, could not be implemented to their fullest potential.
While this situation is not advantageous, it is limited exclusively to
the Maven ecosystem and would not affect other domains such as NPM if
they were to be implemented.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="cyclonedx-sbom-limitations">CycloneDX SBOM
Limitations</h3>
<p>Though CycloneDX SBOMs offering built-in standardization for
<em>deprec</em> and provide valuable information about a dependency,
external references of CycloneDX SBOM components in particular can be
missing or are simply not available. Following that, if a dependency
listed in the SBOM does not provide information that can be directly
utilized in <em>deprec</em>’s extraction phase within the implemented
<em>Extractor</em>, no classification is possible. To extrapolate data
origins from related information, such as combing through GitHub
repositories to associate a repository with the dependency at hand, was
not considered. Though possible, it was deemed as not feasible for
within this work nor its scope.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>The technical concept proposed in <a href="#technical-conception"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="technical-conception">4</a>
was designed following its requirements in <a href="#requirements"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="requirements">3</a>.
Implemented following the same and alongside <a href="#impl-gc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a>,
<em>deprec</em> respectively <em>deprec-cli</em> is to be evaluated in
practice in terms of usability. Focused on in this chapter is the
walkthrough of integrating <em>deprec-cli</em> into continuous
integration pipelines, discussing <em>deprec</em>’s performance and
evaluating its results of classifying dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="integration-into-gitlab-ci">Integration into GitLab CI</h2>
<p>To evaluate usability, <em>deprec</em> respectively
<em>deprec-cli</em>, in unison with <a href="#impl-gc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a>, was
integrated into GitLab’s continuous integration pipelines. An example
project was taken and a pipeline configuration implemented. Listed in <a
href="#appendix:gitlab-integration" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="appendix:gitlab-integration">[appendix:gitlab-integration]</a>
are the two pipeline jobs implemented to integrate
<em>deprec-cli</em>.</p>
<p>Due to <em>deprec-cli</em> taking an SBOM as input, it is important
that wherever <em>deprec-cli</em> is integrated into, an SBOM can be
generated to be passed into <em>deprec-cli</em>. The project taken for
this integration was a productive clients’ project developing an
application in the Maven ecosystem. CycloneDX provides a Maven plugin<a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> to generate SBOMs for projects
built within Maven. As listed, the preceding job in <a
href="#appendix:gitlab-integration" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="appendix:gitlab-integration">[appendix:gitlab-integration]</a>
generates a SBOM for the project with the Maven plugin and saves it to
be handed over.</p>
<p>Following that, <em>deprec-cli</em> can be fetched via its released
artifact from its official repository<a href="#fn44"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>.
The configuration file for the evaluation of <em>deprec</em>’s
<em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> was checked into the
repository prior and can be used inside GitLabs continuous integration
pipelines to be passed to <em>deprec-cli</em>. In addition, necessary
environment variables have to be defined. Instead of passing them
through a separate <em>.env</em> file that would have to be checked into
the repository as the configuration file was, they were passed by
internal GitLab CI/CD variables<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. Given the
configuration setup, <em>deprec-cli</em> can be executed, and its result
exported as an artifact for further inspection.</p>
<p>To be noted, a cache was not utilized. Introducing a cache could
benefit performance in between instances of running ’analyze-sbom’,
though was not feasible with the GitLab runners at hand to have them
share a cache across runners and individual runs.<br />
To summarize, integrating <em>deprec</em> respective <em>deprec-cli</em>
within the premise of continuous integration was achieved without
noteworthy hurdles to overcome. The resulting output of
<em>deprec-cli</em>, though, has to be inspected manually.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Evaluating <em>deprec</em> in terms of its of performance boils down
to measuring the throughput of dependencies by <em>deprec</em>. states
results over performance, though measuring performance to verify that
the implementation at least does not subdue unnecessary performance
losses, was carried out nevertheless. In advance, though rate-limiting
of APIs poses the biggest threat to performance and capability
whatsoever, it is not focused hereinafter and was intentionally
excluded.<br />
Analyzing <em>deprec</em> with different SBOM run-throughs and Go’s
runtime profiling package ’pprof’<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>, the runtime of
<em>Agents</em> representing the time for a dependency to be processed
was measured. In terms of data, <em>deprec</em> revealed average
dependency throughputs based on if run with or without cache listed in
<a href="#tab:deprec-throughput" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="tab:deprec-throughput">[tab:deprec-throughput]</a>.
Though, only 50 dependencies were run for each SBOM due to rate-limiting
reasons. Furthermore, SBOMs of projects not developed within the Maven
ecosystems were used also as <em>Extractors</em> for GitHub and OSS
Index were still viable for extracting data from non-Maven SBOMs.</p>
<p>Resulting that the extraction phase took up most of the runtime of an
<em>Agent</em> by far, two key-takeaways can be distilled:
<strong>(a)</strong> the performance of <em>deprec</em> is profoundly
influenced by both the quantity and magnitude of the dependencies
evaluated; <strong>(b)</strong> the use of a cache has short-term
negative impact of performance, i.e., frequent database operations, that
are traded in for long-term benefits of using a cache, i.e., avoiding
redundancy and expense.</p>
<p>Considering <strong>(b)</strong>, caching can already be beneficial
within the same run of processing SBOMs containing dependencies that are
developed within a monorepo or share common ground, such as the
repositories’ organization. Dependencies processed from the same
developing organization can be cashed in terms of data such as
contributors after the first fetch for every subsequent fetch. This
could explain the discrepancy prevalent between <em>no-cache</em> and
<em>cache</em> when processing <em>Keycloak</em>’s SBOM, since an
increased number of dependencies processed when running
<em>Keycloak</em>’s SBOM shared common ground.</p>

<p>Summarizing <em>deprec</em>’s measured performance regarding <a
href="#gc-and-uc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="gc-and-uc">3.1</a>, its performance was deemed as
acceptable. Considering that API rate-limiting is the far greater threat
to performance and capability, <em>deprec</em>’s performance measured in
exclusion of rate-limiting is of no concern.</p>
<h2 id="classification-results-accuracy">Classification Results –
Accuracy</h2>
<p>Focused on in this section is the evaluation of <em>deprec</em>’s
accuracy in classifying dependencies collected for the evaluation set<a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>. Before evaluating classifications,
though, the evaluation set itself is to be discussed.</p>
<h3 id="bias">Identifying Evaluation Set Biases</h3>
<p>The evaluation set, detrimental to interpreting evaluation results of
<em>deprec</em>’s classifications, though reviewed by colleagues
internally, subdues to non-negligable bias which influenced the
implementation to some degree. Due to that dependencies collected were
subjectively assessed and thus classified, the evaluation set contains,
on the one hand, subjectivity and, on the other hand, sampling bias.
Utilizing the evaluation set to tweak evaluation of <em>Statements</em>
and <em>EOS Factors</em> and therefore the classification of
dependencies may lead to non-representation of dependencies neither
considered for nor contained in the evaluation set.</p>
<p>In consequence, this circumstance must be considered when
interpreting evaluation results about the accuracy of classifications
and therefore the accuracy of <em>deprec</em> itself.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-accuracy">Measuring Accuracy</h3>
<p>Requirement states that though accuracy and success of
<em>deprec</em>’s classification results of dependencies take on a
secondary role, the former has to be discussed to rule out misleading
directions.</p>
<p>Following that, to evaluate <em>deprec</em>’s classification
accuracy, the following evaluation method is proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>given a dependency <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in the
evaluation set, it is pre-classified as one of the four categories
described in <a href="#impl-gc" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="impl-gc">5.1</a> labeled as <span
class="math inline">\(C_{expected,d}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>dependency <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is then
classified by <em>deprec</em>, with the normalized result labeled as
<span class="math inline">\(normalized_d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(normalized_d\)</span> contains the
probabilities for all four categories, with which the probability
corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(C_{expected,d}\)</span> and
labeled as <span class="math inline">\(P_{C_{expected,d}}\)</span> is
extracted.</p></li>
<li><p>finally, <span class="math inline">\(error_d = 1 -
P_{C_{expected,d}}\)</span> is computed, representing the difference
between the actual probability of the expected category and the max
possible probability possible for a category.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With the above preparation applied for all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dependencies in the evaluation set, the
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) specified in <a href="#mse"
data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="mse">[mse]</a> is
computed.<br />
<span class="math display">\[\label{mse}
     MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (error_{d_i})\]</span><br />
Though, since the MAE is not meaningful on its own, the percentages of
how many dependencies have been <em>correctly</em> classified specified
in <a href="#ratio" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="ratio">[ratio]</a> and <em>confident correctly</em>
classified specified in <a href="#ratio-confident"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="ratio-confident">[ratio-confident]</a> are also
considered. A dependency <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
defined as <em>correctly</em> classified if <span
class="math inline">\(P_{C_{expected,d}}\)</span> is the highest
probability among the four probabilities contained in <span
class="math inline">\(normalized_d\)</span>. Following that, all
dependencies <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> <em>correctly</em>
classified are defined as <em>confident correctly</em> classified if
their respective probability <span
class="math inline">\(P_{C_{expected,d}}\)</span> is above a predefined
confidence value. The confidence value is defined as specified in <a
href="#confidence" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="confidence">[confidence]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{confidence}
     confidence = 0.75\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{ratio}
     N_{correct} = \frac{correctly\ classified\ dependencies}{total\
dependencies}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{ratio-confident}
     N_{correct,confident} = \frac{confident\ correctly\ classified\
dependencies}{total\ dependencies}\]</span><br />
Given <span class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct,confident}\)</span>, <em>deprec</em>
can be evaluated in terms of the accuracy of its classification. The
former complements the insights of the latter two, as a high <span
class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> with a high percentage of
<em>correctly</em> classified dependencies would conclude that although
most dependencies were correct classified, <em>deprec</em> was less
confident in doing so. Contrary to that, a low <span
class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> with a high percentage of
<em>correctly</em> classified dependencies would represent the best
possible outcome: most dependencies were classified correct and
<em>deprec</em> did so confidently. Following that, it is to be expected
that the <span class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> should correlate with
<span class="math inline">\(N_{correct}\)</span> and especially <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct,confident}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<p>Elaborating further, based on the described evaluation method and
applied to the evaluation set, the accuracy depicted in <a
href="#fig:deprec_accuracy" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:deprec_accuracy">[fig:deprec_accuracy]</a> for
<em>deprec</em>’s classification results was evaluated using two
configurations concerning weights utilized for the evaluation of
<em>Statements</em>, <em>EOS Factors</em> and the combination of the
latter (hereinafter referenced as <em>Combined</em>). <em>Evenly
Weighted</em>, on the one hand, represents the evaluation configuration
in which all, <em>Signals</em> or <em>Metrics</em> within
<em>Statements</em>, <em>Statements</em> within <em>EOS Factors</em> and
<em>EOS Factors</em> within <em>Combined</em> were weighted equally.
<em>Suggestion</em>, on the other hand, represents the suggested
weighting that was discovered by trial and error for best results<a

</figure>
<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h4>
<p>Analyzing <a href="#fig:deprec_accuracy"
data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:deprec_accuracy">[fig:deprec_accuracy]</a>, the
following interpretations can be concluded: <strong>I</strong> with and
<a href="#bias" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bias">6.3.1</a> in mind, the accuracy in terms of
<em>correctly</em> classified dependencies evaluated for the suggested
configuration is acceptable; <strong>II</strong> <em>Evenly
Weighted</em> though functioning as a comparison for
<em>Suggestion</em>, because of its disastrous confidence and its
percentage of <em>correct</em> classified dependencies being slightly
better than a coin flip, is of no use for further work. This
circumstance was to be expected, as some <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS
Factors</em> are clearly more decisive than others. A blanket equal
weighting is deemed as not beneficial and therefore to be excluded.
<strong>III</strong> given the non-negligable improvement in both the
MAE and classification percentages, when introducing the suggested
weighting, the importance of weighting is clarified. A net gain of 30
percent and 25 percent for <em>correct</em> classified dependencies and
the MAE, respectively, shows that the suggested configuration leads into
right directions. Further, the classification seems to benefit immensely
in its confidence by weighting, with which more profound research into
weighting within <em>Statements</em>, <em>EOS Factors</em>, and
<em>Combined</em> could be the subject of further work;
<strong>IV</strong> based on <em>Evenly Weighted</em> alone though, it
can be concluded that the theoretical concept proposed in <a
href="#theoretic-basis" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="theoretic-basis">2</a> to assess dependencies about
their end-of-support status to classify them as the same leads into the
right direction. Coupled with <em>Suggestion</em>, it is safe to say
that, though the implementation not covering all <em>Statements</em> nor
<em>EOS Factors</em> and to some degree neither implementing them to
their fullest potential, the proposed approach to detecting
end-of-support dependencies is deemed as successful.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-the-importance-of-combination">Identifying the
Importance of Combination</h3>
<p>Complementary to evaluating <em>deprec</em>’s accuracy on the level
of <em>Combined</em>, the same evaluation on accuracy can be applied on
<em>EOS Factor</em> and <em>Statement</em> level to produce more
profound insights. Utilizing the same evaluation method as described
prior, <span class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct,confident}\)</span> were evaluated for
each <em>EOS Factor</em> and <em>Statement</em> independently. <a
href="#fig:deprec_accuracy_factors" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:deprec_accuracy_factors">[fig:deprec_accuracy_factors]</a>
depicts the evaluation on <em>EOS Factor</em> level.</p>
<p>Analyzing the same, the following insights can be generated:
<strong>I</strong> as set forth above when describing the evaluation
method, indeed a correlation between <span
class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct,confident}\)</span> can be observed.
Comparing <span class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_{correct,confident}\)</span>, the two are
linearly proportional to each other. With decreasing <span
class="math inline">\(MAE\)</span> values, <em>EOS Factors</em> gain in
confidence; <strong>II</strong> it may be prevalent that each <em>EOS
factor</em> by itself is not accurate enough to classify dependencies
correctly, the combination of the <em>EOS Factors</em> though improves
the classification on the one hand in percentages of <em>correct</em>
classified dependencies and on the other hand in confidence of doing so.
It further proves that the approach to the problematic of end-of-support
dependencies and especially the theoretical concept proposed in <a
href="#theoretic-basis" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="theoretic-basis">2</a> leads into right
directions.<br />

<p>The insights that <em>EOS Factors</em> independently do not provide
the accuracy needed apart from when in combination, can further be
observed when analyzing <em>Statements</em> isolated. However, as this
would lead to similar looking results and insights as before, this more
profound evaluation will be excluded for brevity to be discussed in this
work, but was nonetheless performed and can be found in <a

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this work has successfully addressed the research
question of end-of-support within open-source dependencies regarding
their potential pitfalls, by conceptualizing and implementing the
software solution <em>deprec</em>, designed to detect end-of-support
dependencies. <em>Deprec</em> mitigates dependencies jeopardizing future
development due to loosing support. With the lack of tooling leveraging
informational use out of the end-of-support status of dependencies,
<em>deprec</em> raises awareness and indicates potentially faulty
dependencies, helping development teams and project management to reduce
risk and expense by enhancing management capabilities and enabling more
timely integration into their planning.<br />
The development and implementation of a technical concept was preceded
by a theoretical concept. It was elaborated, to classify dependencies as
end-of-support with an abstracted and constant methodology in a
comprehensible and approachable way. <em>EOS Factors</em>, which are
grouped from abstracted <em>Statements</em> representing distinct
informational value, represent core characteristics of dependencies in
terms of end-of-support. Given the theoretical concept alongside defined
requirements, the software solution titled <em>deprec</em> was
conceptualized, implemented and integrated as the command line interface
tool <em>deprec-cli</em>: integrating the aforementioned theoretical
concept and evaluating <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> with
data extracted from various data origins, dependencies are classified on
an agent-based framework and a project-based approach by leveraging
CycloneDX’s SBOMs.<br />
<em>Deprec</em> in line with its requirements achieves satisfactory
accuracy and performance in classifying dependencies as end-of-support.
It is easily integrated into different premises, rendering the overall
approach viable for use within practice, especially internally within
Device Insight. In addition, <em>deprec</em> functions project and data
independent and can be expanded to accustom different dependencies for
differing project contexts and use cases. The evaluation of
<em>deprec</em>’s accuracy further validates that the proposed approach
of classifying dependencies as end-of-support by combination of distinct
characteristic factors within the <em>EOS Abstraction Framework</em>
leads into promising directions, whilst also generating insights into
the importance of different weighting strategies and interconnections
between <em>Statements</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em> with and among each
other.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="further-work">Further Work</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="research-into-weighting">Research into
Weighting</h3>
<p>The evaluation of <em>deprec</em> paved the way for further and more
profound research into how different weighting strategies affect
<em>deprec</em>’s classification results. Further research might include
exploring different weighting strategies on the level of
<em>Signals</em> and <em>Metrics</em> within <em>Statements</em>,
<em>Statements</em> within <em>EOS Factors</em> and <em>EOS Factors</em>
among themselves when combining them to conclude the classification of a
dependency, i.e., the end of support status of a dependency. Doing so
might gain insights to distill distinct steps to be taken to improve the
concept of <em>deprec</em>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="extending-deprecs-implementation">Extending
<em>deprec</em>’s implementation</h3>
<p>The implementation of the technical concept of <em>deprec</em> was
focused on proving feasibility and practicability. Expanding
<em>deprec</em>’s extraction phase, and therefore extending
<em>deprec</em> to cover a broader spectrum of different dependencies,
can improve <em>deprec</em> in terms of its capabilities. Starting
points could detail adding <em>Extractors</em> for data origins of
dependencies from different domains or ecosystems other than
implemented. Further, the implementation of evaluating
<em>Statements</em> can be extended to improve the same with more
profound and sophisticated implementation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="deprec-as-service"><em>Deprec</em> as
Service</h3>
<p>Within this work, <em>deprec</em> was implemented as the command line
interface tool <em>deprec-cli</em>. Not considered and contrary to
<em>deprec-cli</em> is the concept of serving <em>deprec</em> as
service. Implementing <em>deprec</em> into a service accepting requests
to analyze dependencies would cover yet another premise and opportunity
of integrating <em>deprec</em> into one’s workflow.</p>
